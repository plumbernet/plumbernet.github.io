If your disposal is often making sounds that are irregular for the machine, it could be in need of significant repairs or it could be nearing the end of its lifespan. Regular blockages, even when you're hardly washing down any food particles, might indicate an issue with the disposal.

Even if you take great care of your drains by covering them and avoiding putting any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, sometimes obstructions are unavoidable. If you have a clogged drain, it is incredibly important that you do not attempt to unclog it yourself because this could potentially result in a large leak and more expensive repairs.</p>
