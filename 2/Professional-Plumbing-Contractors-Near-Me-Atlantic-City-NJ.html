<p>Looking to repair or replace your waste disposal unit? Many clogs are brought on by putting too much bathroom tissue into the bowl. Know how much toilet paper your toilet can efficiently rid the bowl of per flush. Never put any paper product into the toilet bowl other than toilet paper.

We forbid cross connections between safe water and water from a questionable source and prohibit the discharge of contaminated materials to the sewer system. We also check the vent pipes to balance the pressure in the plumbing system.</p>
