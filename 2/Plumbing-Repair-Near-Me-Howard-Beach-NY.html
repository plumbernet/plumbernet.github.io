<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Howard Beach NY</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>This style water heater may make the many sense for you if you have a big bathtub or more that two bathrooms. There are some installation considerations, especially around sizing the gas line and installing the flue vent, however with the capability for a 50-gallon tank to create more hot water than a basic 80-gallon tank, these things are quite unique. High-efficiency storage is a fantastic option for space heating hydronic alternatives too.</p>
