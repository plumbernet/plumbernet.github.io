It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and mixed with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>
