Tankless water heaters cost more to install and purchase than storage systems but conserve money on both energy and water by removing standby heat loss and heating water quicker so less cold water is lost while you wait.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
