During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
