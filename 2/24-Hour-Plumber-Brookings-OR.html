The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
