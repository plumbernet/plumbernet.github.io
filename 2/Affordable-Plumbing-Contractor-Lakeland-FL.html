For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from car washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development may flow in reverse into the drinkable water supply. To safeguard water quality, backflow security is required where the end user presents a danger of contaminating the city's water supply.</p>

Regs. § 19-13-38a( c)( I)).</p>
