<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
