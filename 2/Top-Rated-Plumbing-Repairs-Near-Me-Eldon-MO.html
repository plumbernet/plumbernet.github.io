<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
<p>Drawbacks to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
