<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
