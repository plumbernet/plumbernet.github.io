<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than building up on surface areas. However, if they stay in one place for long, as they might in a water heater, the accumulation might still occur.</p>
