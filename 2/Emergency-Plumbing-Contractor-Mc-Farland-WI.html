<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
