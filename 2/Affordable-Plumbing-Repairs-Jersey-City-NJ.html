Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. A crucial thing to recognize on each component is the guide.

If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities.

In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
