<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Paola KS</h3>
<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will ultimately take its toll. If you observe that your plumbing struggles with various clogs, leaks, and water pressure change that no quantity of repairs seems to stem, you should speak with a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a solution.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
