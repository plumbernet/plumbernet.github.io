<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water.

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
