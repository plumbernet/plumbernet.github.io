<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back because he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
