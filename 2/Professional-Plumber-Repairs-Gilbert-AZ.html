<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
