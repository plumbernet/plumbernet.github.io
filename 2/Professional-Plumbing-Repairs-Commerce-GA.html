<p>A lot of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to wear away.

As the outer finish of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
