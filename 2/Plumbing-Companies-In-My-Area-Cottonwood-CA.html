This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive.

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is merely recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (usually sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
