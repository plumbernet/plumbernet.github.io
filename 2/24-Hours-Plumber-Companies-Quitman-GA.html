<p>All you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) once you have actually found the trip lever you desire eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct method. When you have actually secured the trip lever and are prepared to hook up your flapper, make certain you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
