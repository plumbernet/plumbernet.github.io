<p>When compared to gas models, electrical designs are easier and less expensive to install as electricity is currently available through the main power supply line. For gas hot water heater, a particular gas line has to be installed and a viable source of gas established. Another function of an electrical hot water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas designs need to be ventilated correctly using vents and ducts in order to operate properly. With electric designs, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems generally are set up in big, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
