<p>From underneath the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make certain the drain compression seal is seated properly in the drain locknut, then re-install and tighten up the drain locknut. Finally, switch on the water and test for leakages.</p>
<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck.
