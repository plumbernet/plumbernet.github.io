<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>You can utilize a wire coat wall mount by correcting it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some clogs. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
