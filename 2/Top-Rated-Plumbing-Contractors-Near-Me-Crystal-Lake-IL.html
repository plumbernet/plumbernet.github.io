<p>This short article aims to address the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: a properly set up water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a few confusing truths that typically lead people to this incorrect conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is generally destructive. For that reason, softened water must also be corrosive, ideal? This is a misconception because naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>

<p>Please let EBMUD understand of any situation that may need a backflow device. In some cases conditions on homes change that might need a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with ingredients or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a trouble for your service, they can trigger financial losses and in some instances can stop your service totally. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be disastrous. Even in a little workplace the issues triggered by even little drain problems can cause significant problems.</p>
<p>Testing must be completed by a contractor signed up with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor needs to have a legitimate, updated plumbing license, current insurance, backflow preventer testing accreditation, and presently adjusted test set. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is required.</p>
