To keep your sink smelling fresh and running clear, pour in equivalent parts of vinegar and baking soda regularly. For routine cleaning, you'll just need about one-half cup of each.

While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment.

When that occurs, you will probably need to call a plumber anyhow to fix your errors, and possibilities are they will cost more and be more difficult than if you had actually just called a professional in the very first location.</p>
