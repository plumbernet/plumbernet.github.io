The mainstay for regular fire security applications, DCVs feature an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, two separately operating spring-loaded check valves (typically inside a single valve body), four test cocks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade garbage disposals begin around $500-$ 2,500 and increase depending upon size, brand name and functions.</p>
