<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe.

The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it need to be much less water.</p>
