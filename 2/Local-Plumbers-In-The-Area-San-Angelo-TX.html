<p>Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the drinkable water system within a structure these devices are known as isolation" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no other way to provide one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is set up.
