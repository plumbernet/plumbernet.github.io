<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continuously bringing tanks online and off-line in action to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
