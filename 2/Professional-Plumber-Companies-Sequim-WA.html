<h3>How to Save Water With Leak Detection Awareness in Sequim WA 98382</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
