<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Absecon NJ</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be changed. Schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and ensure absolutely nothing is near the heater that could be possibly damaged if it is in a garage and a small sluggish leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
