Even if you don't have need for a dishwasher, if your home ever alters hands, new owners might value the alternative.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as tough water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 various events, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were great. They quickly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a big mess. They, as with everyone we have actually experienced with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, timely, and extremely well-informed. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anybody needing either small or big job plumbing work.</p>
