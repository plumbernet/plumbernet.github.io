For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
