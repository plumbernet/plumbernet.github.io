If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being useful to manufacture until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. established an approach to plasticize PVC, making it simpler to process. PVC pipe began to be made in the 1940s and remained in wide use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics makers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe.
