<p>Your sewer line is one of the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or damaged, it could wreak undesirable concerns on your residential or commercial property. A home's service line (likewise referred to as a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the homeowner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for keeping the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.
