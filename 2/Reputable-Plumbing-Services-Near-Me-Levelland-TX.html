<p>While tank and tankless water heaters may vary in their moduses operandi, there is one thing that they share in common with the others: They all should be set up by proficient, qualified specialists.

Galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber when discovered and changed with another pipe material.</p>
