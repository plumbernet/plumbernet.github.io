Although these property owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the issue worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a really pricey choice.</p>
<p>Another duty of the Plumbing Department is to carry out cross connection inspections to recognize drinkable water supply that need being secured from contaminates. The cross connection control program is needed by the State of Michigan's Safe Drinking Water Act 1976 PA 399.

Pointer: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation.

After a couple of minutes, run warm water down the drain. Unattainable or inadequate cleanouts: No matter how effective a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged at some time.
