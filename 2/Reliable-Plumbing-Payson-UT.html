If your disposal is often making sounds that are unusual for the machine, it could be in need of major repairs or it might be nearing the end of its life-span. Frequent blockages, even when you're hardly washing down any food particles, might show a problem with the disposal. It is probably due to too much use over a long duration of time if there are leakages coming from your system. Much of these leakages can be fixed, but if they become bigger and more frequent, you must consider overall system replacement.</p>
