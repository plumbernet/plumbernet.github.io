<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
