<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
