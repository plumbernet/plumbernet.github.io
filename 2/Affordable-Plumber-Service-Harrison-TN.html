Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
