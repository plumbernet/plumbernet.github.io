<h3>Sink Leaking in Saginaw Michigan</h2>
<p>Without a water softener, laundry demands extra cleaning agent to avoid it from looking dingy. Dishes will come out of your dishwasher spotted and stained.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
