<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>

As a subcontractor, those choices may have currently been made. We have established a group of contractors we have actually worked for in the past, and this has led to some company that has actually not included competitive bidding," Stegle says.</p>
<p>Hard water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the option by the sodium ions.</p>
