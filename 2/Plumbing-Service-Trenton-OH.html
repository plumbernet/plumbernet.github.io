<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
