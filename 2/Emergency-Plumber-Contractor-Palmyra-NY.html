<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>Our knowledgeable professionals have lots of systems and techniques of the trade that can actually minimize the effect on the home and prevent much of the wall and tile repair. From threading pipes through existing holes to specially designed cover plates for shower valves, it might not be as intrusive as you may think.
