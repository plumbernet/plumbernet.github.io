It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the salt, or salt, is saved and blended with water. , if you prepare to drain your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>

Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
