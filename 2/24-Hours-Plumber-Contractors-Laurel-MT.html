Your house is over ten years old, and you have actually never had the sewer and drain lines checked. Some plumbers might get professional discounts from sellers or kitchen and bath display rooms. If you need a new sink or faucet, compare their costs with what you can find online or at home improvement shops. They might be getting you a much better deal</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific guy. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as promised. I will certainly use Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
