<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

Constant feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal particles can often get caught in the blades. This can harm the blades and need repairs.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make sure the drain compression seal is seated properly in the drain locknut, then tighten up the drain and reinstall locknut. Last but not least, turn on the water and test for leaks.</p>
