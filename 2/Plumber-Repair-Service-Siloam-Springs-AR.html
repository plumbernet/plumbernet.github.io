<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they weaken over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to various kinds of corrosion. After about fifty years, they'll start to compromise from deterioration and may place contaminants into the freshwater supply. We suggest replacing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your home.
