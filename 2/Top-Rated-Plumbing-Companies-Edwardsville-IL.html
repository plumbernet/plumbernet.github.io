Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
