If your energy bills are increasing, a new, higher efficiency water heater can bring them pull back. All that needs to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, allowing difficult water to flow to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, transferred to its brand-new place and put there.</p>
