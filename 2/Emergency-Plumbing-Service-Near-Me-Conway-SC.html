<h3>Basic Methods for Refrigerant Leak Detection in Conway SC 29526</h3>
<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is merely capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
