<p>Seattle Public Utilities checks backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be checked by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report must be offered to us. Get cleaner clothes, remove rust areas, and utilize less detergent when you soften your laundry water. Whole-house models are appropriate for washing makers, or you can attempt laundry additive water softening products.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless most of the times it must be much less water.</p>
