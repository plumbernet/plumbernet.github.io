<p>Deterioration: The most common issue is corrosion in the tank and pipes that connect to your hot water heater. This is particularly true if you have without treatment difficult water, which contains harsh minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the product with time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another element that is triggering the corrosion, you will ultimately experience a leak in your water heater that is challenging to repair. Leaks frequently indicate a new unit replacement remains in order.</p>

When a repiping service is required, this includes getting rid of damaged sections of old piping and setting up new piping in its location. This is required to support the plumbing system and ensure the structural stability.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the defective pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately struggles with rust and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
