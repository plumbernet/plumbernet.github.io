<p>Lastly, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water streams at style pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if pricey) device is best utilized in crucial areas where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
