<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical substance that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than building up on surface areas. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the buildup could still happen.</p>
