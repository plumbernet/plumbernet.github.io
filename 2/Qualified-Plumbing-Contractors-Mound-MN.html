Some hard water problems are very noticeable, like sprayers and dispensers ending up being clogged. Other problems can go unnoticed, like scale on water heater aspects and buildup in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Noticeable or invisible, these problems have actually genuine expenses related to them. Clogged components trigger replacement or refurbishing expenses and can frustrate your clients. Scale accumulation in your hot water heater will inflate your energy expenses, and too soon damaged RO membranes will leave you with unnecessary replacement costs.
