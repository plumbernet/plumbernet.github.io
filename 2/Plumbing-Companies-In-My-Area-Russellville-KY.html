<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Russellville KY</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might require somewhat different steps than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, however possibilities are you'll locate among the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
