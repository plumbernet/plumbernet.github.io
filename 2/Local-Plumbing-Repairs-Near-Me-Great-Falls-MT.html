<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Great Falls MT</h3>
<p>Most houses or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather condition protection. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>We need to clarify a little terms before we continue with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly includes an inlet and outlet shut off, appropriately located test dicks, and the required parts of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet).

A component can even more be broken down into its individual parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are put together to make elements, and components are assembled to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
