Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no other way to provide one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed.

<p>Drawbacks to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
