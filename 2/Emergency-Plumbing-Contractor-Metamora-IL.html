<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent.

This triggers the disc to open, permitting air to bring back and go into the valve pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
