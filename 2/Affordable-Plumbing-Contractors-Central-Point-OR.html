<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
