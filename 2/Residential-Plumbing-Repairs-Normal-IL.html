<p>If you see an odor or unpleasant odor coming from your system, which is not unusual, consider purchasing a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can get away. These flanges are commonly available and easy to install, costing around $30 at home improvement or hardware shops. Shut off the water system to your home at the main line. To avoid leaks from springing during the installation process, shut down the water supply to your home. Make sure your water heater's water system is turned off, as is the electrical power running to the unit.</p>

These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
