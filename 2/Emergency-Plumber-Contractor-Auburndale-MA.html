<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be provided to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste better. The minerals in hard water can cause a bad odor and taste. When you add a water softener, it gets rid of the mineral material to produce odor-free drinking water that tastes excellent.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by constantly bringing tanks off-line and online in action to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
<p>If there is a leak, we will locate the leak and shut the gas line down at the main line if it has not already been completed. Then, our technician will dig to discover the gas line and leak.
