<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler typically are set up in locations where water could cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system.

<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health threat conditions. They should be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It needs to also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not allow the usage of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only secure versus back siphonage.</p>
