<h3>How to Do Home Plumbing Inspection Yourself at Birmingham AL 35242</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the marketplace and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean.

For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
