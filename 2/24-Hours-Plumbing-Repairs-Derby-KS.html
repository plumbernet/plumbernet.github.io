<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, heater, and boiler, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these small deposits are harmless, but in time they develop and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water circulation, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
