<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
