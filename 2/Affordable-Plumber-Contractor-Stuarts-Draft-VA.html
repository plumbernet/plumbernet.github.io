<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

<p>Pressure Vacuum Breaker. You will need to acquire the manufacturer's pressure loss information for the pressure vacuum breaker you prepare to use. As a general guideline pressure losses for pressure vacuum breakers vary between 2 and 5 PSI, so using 5 PSI would be a relatively safe figure. InSinkErator is the world's most popular garbage disposal brand with typical rates ranging from $80 to $283. One of their best inexpensive garbage disposal alternatives is the Badger 5 for $85.</p>
<p>Natural gas lines are a wonderful, more affordable energy alternative for house owners and commercial homeowner alike.

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
