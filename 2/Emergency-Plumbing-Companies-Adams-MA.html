<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
