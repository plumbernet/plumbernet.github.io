<p>Think about all the locations water streams in and out of your house. These are the locations that a professional assessment ought to cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other home appliances. Even your water lines must be covered. While your water heater and toilets will receive unique attention, a skilled plumber wants to take a look at the complete health of your system. That indicates testing for correct water pressure. After all, too much pressure can damage your plumbing, and too little can leave your house with dysfunctional water home appliances.</p>

To find an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but chances are you'll find among the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
