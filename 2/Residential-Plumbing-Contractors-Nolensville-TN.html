<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a very important part of the design of each component. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the component, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
