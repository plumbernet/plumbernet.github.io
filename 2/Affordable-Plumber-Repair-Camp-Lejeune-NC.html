<p>Many backflow preventers are created to enable the parts to be gotten rid of for repair while the main body stays set up in the piping system. Eliminating the backflow preventer to repair it is not needed most of the times. Some elements such as relief valve bodies may need to be eliminated from the main body to assist in a repair. Understanding the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be essential.</p>
