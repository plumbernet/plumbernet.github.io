<h3>Basic Methods for Refrigerant Leak Detection in Winter Haven FL 33880</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
