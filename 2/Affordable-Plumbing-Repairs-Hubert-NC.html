<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are long lasting in the short-term, they degrade over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to various types of rust. After about fifty years, they'll start to compromise from rust and might position toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the steel, clay, and iron pipes in your house. This may not need completely repiping your house, since newer materials might have already been used in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing.
