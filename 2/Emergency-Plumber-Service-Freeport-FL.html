<h3>How To Avoid A Drain Plumbing Emergency Freeport FL</h3>
<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if required. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may have to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
