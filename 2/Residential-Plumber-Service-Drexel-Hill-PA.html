<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>
