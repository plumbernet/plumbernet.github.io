<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Stockton CA</h3>

<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
