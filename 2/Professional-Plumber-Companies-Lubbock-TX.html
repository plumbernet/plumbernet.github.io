<p>A camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your yard. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images captured by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
