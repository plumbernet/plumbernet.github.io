<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Structure Standards Code, commonly referred to as "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to achieve consistency among the numerous jurisdictions within the State; reduce the structure's energy and water use; lower waste; and lower the carbon footprint. Continuous feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal debris can often get caught in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>
