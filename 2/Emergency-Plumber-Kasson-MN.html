Hydro-jetting is a sophisticated kind of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to completely clear out everything inside your drains. Lay the waste disposal unit on its side and remove the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen up the green ground screw and remove wire ports. Disconnect garbage disposal wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp adapter and eliminate wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
