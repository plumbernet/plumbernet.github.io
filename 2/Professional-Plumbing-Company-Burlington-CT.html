For water pressure to be appropriate, the lines must be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in size to offer appropriate circulation.</p>
<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, shut of the power to it at your main breaker panel before your start loosening any pipes or supply lines. Whole-house repiping can definitely be a large endeavor, which is why the service is just performed when absolutely required.

Changing and setting up brand-new pipes can take anywhere between 3-5 days depending upon the size of your home.</p>

Disconnect waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp connector and get rid of wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
