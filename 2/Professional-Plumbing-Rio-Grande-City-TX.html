It could be in need of significant repairs or it might be nearing the end of its life-span if your disposal is often making sounds that are unusual for the machine. Frequent obstructions, even when you're barely washing down any food particles, could suggest a problem with the disposal. If there are leakages coming from your system, it is most likely due to excessive use over an extended period of time. Many of these leakages can be fixed, but if they become larger and more regular, you should consider overall system replacement.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
