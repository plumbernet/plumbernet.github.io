<p>If the sink is no longer draining pipes as quickly as it once did, there's a good chance it's due to the fact that the garbage disposal is clogged. Not only can a clogged disposal cause the sink to drain slowly, it can also cause filthy water to flow back into the sink. A garbage disposal repair service can help identify and fix a clogged waste disposal unit.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair costs might be in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>
