<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of removing the clog with unfavorable pressure, it really presses into the clog, working even more into where the blockage is happening.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped suggestion helps require it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
<p>Disadvantages to be aware of is that hybrid hot water heater need to be installed in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater.
