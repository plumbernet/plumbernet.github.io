If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task. To discover a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but possibilities are you'll locate among the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
