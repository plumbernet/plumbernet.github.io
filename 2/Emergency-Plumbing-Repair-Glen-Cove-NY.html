If you notice that your plumbing suffers from numerous obstructions, leaks, and water pressure change that no amount of repairs appears to stem, you need to seek advice from a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as an option. House owners should examine water pressure coming into their house on a regular basis. Water pressure ought to be about 55 to 60 PSI; some city water pressure can come in at over 100 PSI.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper may require slightly various steps than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To discover an ideal replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but chances are you'll locate one of the very same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
