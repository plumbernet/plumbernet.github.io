<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if necessary. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might have to increase or decrease the vent size to make sure the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems need the support of a professional. Some small clogs can be taken care of with a plunger and often, when the toilet won't stop running, it's a simple matter of changing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. However, certain concerns do call for a qualified plumber, and it's important to know the difference to avoid squandered money, disappointment, and time.</p>
