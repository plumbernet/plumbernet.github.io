Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become practical to produce until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a method to plasticize PVC, making it much easier to process. PVC pipe began to be manufactured in the 1940s and remained in large use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics producers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe.
