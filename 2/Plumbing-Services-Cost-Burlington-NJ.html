<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or irreversible connection between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
