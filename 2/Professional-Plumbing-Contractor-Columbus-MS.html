<p>Leaks are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften difficult water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
