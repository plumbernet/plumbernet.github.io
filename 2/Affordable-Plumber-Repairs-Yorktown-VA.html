<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to work with a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair costs might remain in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800).
