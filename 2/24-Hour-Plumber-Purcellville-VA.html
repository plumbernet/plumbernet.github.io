Excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
