When we are finished, your hot water heater will be back in good working order, and you can avoid the need for expensive repairs.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by constantly bringing tanks online and off-line in response to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
