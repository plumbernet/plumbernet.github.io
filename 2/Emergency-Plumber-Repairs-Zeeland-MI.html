A great general rule is to replace faucets that show deterioration, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and corroded parts make repairs difficult and pricey, indicating a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the right fix for problems such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little parts of the whole component. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
<p>When they are captured in a timely fashion, keep in mind that the bulk of plumbing problems are simple for a professional to fix.
