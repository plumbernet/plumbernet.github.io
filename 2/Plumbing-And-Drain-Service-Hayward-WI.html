For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to break and harden or simply be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so used or corroded that they spring a leak.
