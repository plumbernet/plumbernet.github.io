<p>In water supply systems, water is generally kept at a significant pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
