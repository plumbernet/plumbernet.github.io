<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is without hardness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
