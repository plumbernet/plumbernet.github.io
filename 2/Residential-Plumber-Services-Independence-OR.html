<p>Plastic pipe is in large use for domestic water supply and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being useful to manufacture till 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. established a technique to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe started to be manufactured in the 1940s and remained in wide usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics makers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The approach for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also established in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have ended up being increasingly typical, with a range of fittings and materials used.</p>
