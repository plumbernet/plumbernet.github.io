<p>Lastly, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best utilized in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>

When the piping in your house begins to show any of these signs of deterioration, you will undoubtedly need to repipe the whole plumbing system.</p>
