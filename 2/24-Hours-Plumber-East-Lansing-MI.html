A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in private residences, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from receding out and infecting the general public water system.</p>

One method to evaluate for any leaks in your plumbing is to switch off all water appliances in your home and outdoors (sprinklers, pipes, etc.). Then find and view the numbers on your house's water meter. You have a leak if the numbers go up after 20-30 minutes. And the quicker those numbers go up, the larger the leak.</p>
<p>Property owners can practice preventive maintenance to prevent future drainage issues. Once a. month, use a plunger in your shower and tub drains to remove any stuck-on particles. Put warm water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice and salt in the garbage disposal to eliminate grease. Another excellent trick is using a drain strainer to stay out hair and soap scum from getting in your pipes.</p>
