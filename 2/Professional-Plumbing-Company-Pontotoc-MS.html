If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task. To find a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, however opportunities are you'll find one of the exact same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
