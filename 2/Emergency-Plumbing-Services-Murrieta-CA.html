<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each element. If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the element, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities.
