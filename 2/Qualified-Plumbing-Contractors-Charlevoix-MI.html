<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
