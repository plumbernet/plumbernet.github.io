<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if essential. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You may have to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
