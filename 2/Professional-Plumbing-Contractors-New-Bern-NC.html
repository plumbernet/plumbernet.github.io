<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced due to the fact that of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.
