<p>Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the potable water system within a structure these gadgets are known as isolation" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub.

If not-- or if there is no disposal presently in place-- start by eliminating the old drain. Most drains are connected to the sink by a big nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
