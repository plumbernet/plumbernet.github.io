<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
