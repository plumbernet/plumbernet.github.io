<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Lockport LA</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
