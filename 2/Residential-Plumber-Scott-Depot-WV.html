<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
