This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

The results of elevated temperature can also trigger extreme pressure conditions which might harm the parts in the components.

<p>Pro Suggestion: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet.

This is also the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
