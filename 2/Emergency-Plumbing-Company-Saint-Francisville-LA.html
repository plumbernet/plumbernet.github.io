That drip-drip-drip noise from your sink can be frustrating, however it's more than just a nuisance. Leaky faucets can harm your house and your wallet, triggering severe water damage and leaving you with high water expenses.

<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health threat if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
