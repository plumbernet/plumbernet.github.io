<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair bill might be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the brand-new heater.</p>
