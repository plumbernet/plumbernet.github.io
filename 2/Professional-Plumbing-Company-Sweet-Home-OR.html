<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
