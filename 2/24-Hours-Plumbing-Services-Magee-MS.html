Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Sinkholes do not just happen in your lawn, regrettably, when a sewer line breaks. The best you can hope for is to find out rapidly if there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running underneath your home's structure. Otherwise, as the leaky sewer line spills out underneath your house, a sinkhole will trigger the structure to shift and develop fractures. In this case, you'll need professional plumbers in addition to foundation repair experts.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regrowth usually takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
