This can trigger low circulation problems or even stop a fixture from streaming altogether. The next typical issue that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which takes place when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it lowers the available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>

You can set up to have extra pipes put in at this time if you need to broaden your water service for a remodel if you want.</p>
