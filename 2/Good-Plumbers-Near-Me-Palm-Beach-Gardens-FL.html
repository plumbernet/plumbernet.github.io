<p>Seattle Public Utilities inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be tested by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report need to be supplied to us. Get cleaner clothing, get rid of rust areas, and utilize less cleaning agent when you soften your laundry water.
