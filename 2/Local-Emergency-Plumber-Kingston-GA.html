<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some houses were permitted to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the house.

Backflow preventers have springs, rubber seals and other moving parts that wear gradually and it is necessary that they receivethe same routine maintenance that your car or HEATING AND COOLING system gets to ensure your family's water is clean & safe.</p>
