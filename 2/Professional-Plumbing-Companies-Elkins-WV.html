<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation instructions within a piping system that is brought on by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of regular circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
