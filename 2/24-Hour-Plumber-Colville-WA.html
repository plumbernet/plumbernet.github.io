<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
