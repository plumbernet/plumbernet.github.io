<p>The anode rod in your water heater is developed to draw in corrosion-causing components in the water, helping to avoid the steel tank from corroding. The best way to avoid drain clogs is to view what you flush. If you look at your house's plumbing pipes and see spots, discoloration, flaking, small indentations or rust, your pipes are corroding. Wearing away pipes are more likely to spring a leak (if they haven't already) and need to be replaced as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Lakeville MN</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leaks and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
