<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle often. When your water lines are repiped, it simply implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing significant and regular leakages. If you do have frequent leaks, we discover that repiping can really be the cheaper and much better long-lasting service.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another typical leak-prone area. These can also be challenging to repair as they are usually located behind the sink, in confined areas. The very best method to tighten them is with a pair of locking pliers. Wrenches use up too much area and need a large swing angle, which may be difficult to obtain in little spaces.</p>
