<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>First turn off the power to the hot water heater at your main electrical panel. Then follow the exact same draining pipes treatments when it comes to a gas water heater.

That way, you will not be repairing the exact same disposal two weeks later on.</p>
