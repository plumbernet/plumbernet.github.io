The majority of people dump food waste in the garbage, which indicates more garbage to go in landfills or be incinerated. Besides being bad for the environment, it's frequently smelly and typically utilizes plastic bags to bring the waste. Worse, food waste can ferment in landfills instead of breaking down.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these little deposits are safe, but in time they build up and ultimately clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can considerably restrict the water circulation, which puts unnecessary pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
