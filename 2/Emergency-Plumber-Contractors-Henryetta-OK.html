Some parts might have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each part. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the component, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities.
