<p>Leaks are tricky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
