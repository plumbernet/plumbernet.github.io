Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a very critical part of the style of each part. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities.

For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
