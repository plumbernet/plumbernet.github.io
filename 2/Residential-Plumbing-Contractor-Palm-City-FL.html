When your drains are clogged, you will probably begin to observe gurgling sounds, water backing up into your sink or shower, or strange smells. Drain blockages are brought on by wear and tear or an accumulation of things we put down the drain over time and as we understand, they can trigger major plumbing problems.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to hire a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair bill might remain in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>
