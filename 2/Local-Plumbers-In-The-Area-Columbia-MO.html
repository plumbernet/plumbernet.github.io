A water softener saves you from replacing prematurely messed up water heaters, scaly faucet heads, and hours and hours of tidying up soapy residue.

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
