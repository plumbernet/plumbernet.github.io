<p>Culpeper House Services offers professional waste disposal unit solutions throughout Culpeper County. We will present you with options for repair or replacement and suggest the best service depending on your specific needs. For double-bowl sinks, the best way to go about things is to utilize a constant waste disposer kit including a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such sets direct both drains to a single trap. Depending on the area of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet package.</p>
