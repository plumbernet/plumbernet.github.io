<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient working a requirement more than a need.

Leaking faucets such as shower valves, tub faucets and sink faucets do not get replaced when repiped.</p>
<p>A malfunctioning garbage disposal, grease accumulation, built up food and more can all contribute to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the centerpiece in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will cause problems. There are a variety of ways homeowners can unclog a kitchen sink, including using a sink plunger, snaking the drain, or utilizing a solution of vinegar and baking soda. For the more severe clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>

Lye is developed to eat through obstructions and dissolve them, however it also penetrates your pipes and produces weak points that are susceptible to rupture.</p>
<p>Examining the water meter is a fantastic next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and examine if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this might be severe issue. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in your house need to have water.
