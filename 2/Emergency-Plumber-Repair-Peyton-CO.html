<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the style of each part. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities.
