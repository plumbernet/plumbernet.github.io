<h3>Why Plumbers Should Install Water Heaters in Walled Lake MI 48390?</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is merely capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>

When an ion exchanger is applied for water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as salt or potassium. The outcome of our advanced water softener technology is healthier, smoother water for you and your household, while still preserving an efficient flow rate.</p>
