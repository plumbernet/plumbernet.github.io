<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is delicate to water pressure and depends on a good balance of water pressure in order to work successfully. If your showers end up being frustrating, or it appears little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it might be time for a sewer repair. The cost depends on the size of the home and the number of bathrooms and plumbing components-- utility room, wet bar, mud room, and so on. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to gain access to the plumbing will add $500 or more to your last costs.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely pictured.

That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
