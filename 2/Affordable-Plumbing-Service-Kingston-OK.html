<p>Do you prepare to use fertigation (fertilizer injected into the irrigation water), apply fertilizer, pesticides (such as for insect control), or apply anything aside from pure water using your watering system? This includes products identified as natural", natural", and safe". This also includes the safe" mosquito control products applied by sprinklers and misters. Keep in mind all these products are concentrated in the irrigation system water, so while they may be safe when distributed into the air, they can be much more harmful when focused in the water in the pipes.</p>
<p>Hard water reduces the lifespan of numerous significant devices and systems in your house due to the amount of limescale and sediment accumulation that happens. Limescale on pipes can cause corrosion and blockages, which not just shortens the life-span of the pipes but puts you in a position where you might need to pay for an expensive repair. Buildup in pipes can likewise result in a boost of water pressure, which can damage the whole sewer system and significantly increase the possibilities of a pipe bursting due to stress.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This triggers the disc to open, permitting air to restore and get in the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
