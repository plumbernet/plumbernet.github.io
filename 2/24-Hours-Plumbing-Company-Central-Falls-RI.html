<p>Drawbacks to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
