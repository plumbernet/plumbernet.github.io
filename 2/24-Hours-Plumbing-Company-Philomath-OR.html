<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
