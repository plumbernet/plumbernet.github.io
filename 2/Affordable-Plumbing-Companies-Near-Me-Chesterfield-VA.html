When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health danger if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for effectiveness, as well as inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
