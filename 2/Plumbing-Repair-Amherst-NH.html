This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is just recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (normally sodium or often potassium).</p>
