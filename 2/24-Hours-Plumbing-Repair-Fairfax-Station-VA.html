<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions.

All that needs to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, permitting tough water to flow to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, transferred to its new place and put there.</p>
