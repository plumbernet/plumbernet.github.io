<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than removing the blockage with negative pressure, it really pushes into the blockage, working further into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
