<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as difficult water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Residences that were built prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how helpful, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in homes that is not lead based). You may not want to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>Apprentices earn less than totally trained plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters. However, their pay increases as they find out to do more.
