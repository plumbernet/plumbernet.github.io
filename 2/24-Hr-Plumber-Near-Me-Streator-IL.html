<p>Spotty dishes? Some underground gutter drains end in the sewer system rather of at the edge of your yard. In that case, measure from the downspout to the nearest manhole, and use an auger line at least that long to guarantee you're cleaning the entire pipe. A waste disposal unit will last 10 to 12-years, and many guarantees cover the very first 2 to 5-years. When acquiring a new unit, keep this in mind.</p>
