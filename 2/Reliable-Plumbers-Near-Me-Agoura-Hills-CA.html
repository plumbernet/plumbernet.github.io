A house's service line (also referred to as a sewer lateral) ranges from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the property owner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Agoura Hills CA</h3>
<p>Throughout sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates service technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light attached to it into the sewer line at your property. The camera is by hand manipulated on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light supplies a clear image for the specialist to accurately analyze conditions and identify the functionality of the pipes. The details we obtain from the inspection allows us to make an informed choice regarding the condition of your pipes and recommend the best service too. We can make the ideal suggestion with confidence if the pipe needs to be cleaned up of blockages or relined with epoxy resin.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another common leak-prone area. These can also be tough to repair as they are generally located behind the sink, in confined spaces. The very best method to tighten them is with a set of locking pliers. Wrenches take up too much area and need a large swing angle, which may be difficult to obtain in little areas.</p>
