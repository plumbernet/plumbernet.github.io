<p>This, again, is because of the minerals present in the water you are using to clean them with. With soft water, you do not have that issue because it lacks the minerals that remain in difficult water.

<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical. To remove the disposer, support it from below and turn the big, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Eliminate the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
