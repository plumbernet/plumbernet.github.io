<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will accumulate in various parts of the plumbing system, a lot of frequently in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow concerns and even stop a fixture from streaming completely. The next typical problem that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which takes place when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so extreme that it lowers the available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as difficult water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, known as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house. Plumbers can replace or fix blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them working correctly. Leaking pipes can affect your indoor air quality. Call today at (979) 200-6674 to have your plumbing inspected and we will let you know if a repipe in Brenham is best for you.</p>
