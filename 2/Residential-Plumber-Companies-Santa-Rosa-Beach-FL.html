<p>In some neighborhoods, house water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to get rid of chloride. The chloride passes through the treatment plant and ends up in our lakes and streams. In homes with personal wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic tank and then ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
