<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe at Haleyville AL 35565</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
