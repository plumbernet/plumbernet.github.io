Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If permitted to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the contaminated water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, as well as examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
