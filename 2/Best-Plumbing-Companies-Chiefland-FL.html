<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of consistent or direct) of the part, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
