<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and fulfill our rigid trust accreditation requirements. An excellent general rule is to replace faucets that reveal corrosion, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and rusted parts make repairs challenging and costly, suggesting a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the appropriate fix for concerns such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the whole component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>

This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position.
