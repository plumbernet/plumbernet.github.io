<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
