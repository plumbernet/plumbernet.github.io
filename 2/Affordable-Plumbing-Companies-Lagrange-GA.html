<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals discovered in water. Generally, minerals get there since groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues take a trip with the water up until it remains in your home. Water softening uses an ion exchange procedure to get rid of dissolved minerals that aren't as effectively eliminated by mechanical filtration. These products are what triggers difficult water.</p>
