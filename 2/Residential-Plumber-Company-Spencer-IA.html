<p>2 styles of PVBs are readily available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. A PVB may be used to isolate health or non-health hazards but works versus back-siphonage just.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as hard water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
<p>A review of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly must then be evaluated. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure changes and disc compression that could lead to false data on the workings of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can lead to extreme pressure spikes that might harm elements. The effects of elevated temperature can also trigger extreme pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the components. These and other unfavorable results from the hydraulic conditions need to be acknowledged and their cause fixed. If parts are changed and the hydraulic conditions are not remedied, the new parts can quickly be made inoperative.</p>
