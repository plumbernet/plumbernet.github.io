<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Walkersville MD 21793</h3>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is simply capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
