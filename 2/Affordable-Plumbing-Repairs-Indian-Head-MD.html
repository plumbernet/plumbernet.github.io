<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively envisioned.

That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
