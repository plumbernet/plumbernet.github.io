We figure out backflow danger by examining the kind of business, how the business utilizes water, and what kind of equipment or appliances are connected to the building's supply of water system.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, enabling air to restore and get in the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
