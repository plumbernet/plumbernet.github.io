<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits accumulate, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
