<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
