<h3>Things To Know Before Hiring A Sewer Cleaning Company in Santa Cruz CA 95060</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions.

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is simply capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
