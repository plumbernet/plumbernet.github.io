<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than developing on surfaces. However, if they remain in one place for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the accumulation might still take place.</p>

It is important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to guarantee no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
<p>To make positioning a toilet much easier, new toilet bolts are extra long. That indicates you need to cut off the protruding ends later with a hacksaw.
