Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created due to the fact that of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals.
