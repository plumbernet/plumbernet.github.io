Please call our Building Inspections Department, at 804-501-4360, if you have any questions about what is needed for each inspection or if you need assistance scheduling an inspection.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions.

The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>

A stop work order will specify the reason for its issuance and the conditions which must be satisfied before work will be allowed to resume.</p>
