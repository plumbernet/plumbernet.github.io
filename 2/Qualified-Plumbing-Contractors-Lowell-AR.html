Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>

For example, a Thumbtack pro in Alvin, Texas, charges $300 for a sewer camera inspection.
