<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically two layers of security. The device enables water to push the check valves open when water is entering into the building, but closes them shut when water tries to go the wrong way. There are two various types of testable backflow prevention devices that are frequently specified-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a couple of others that I will discuss but do not get hung up on them. I mention them only due to the fact that they will be on a certification test.</p>
