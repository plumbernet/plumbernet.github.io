<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Andover NJ 07821</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (usually salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
