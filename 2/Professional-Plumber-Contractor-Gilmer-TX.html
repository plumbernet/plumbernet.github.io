When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have actually never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and major leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can actually be the less expensive and much better long-term service if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
