<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than stable or direct) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities.

In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
