<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water system line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leaks and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
