<p>Find the ideal water softener for you. One typical way for a home's water supply to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines.

<p>List prices for house water softeners may range from roughly $400 to $2,700, depending upon the size and kind of softener. Softeners are ranked by the total number of grains the system can remove before being recharged. The cost of salt is approximately $5 to $8 per 40-pound bag of salt chloride (NaCl), depending on the kind acquired, and approximately $25 per 40-pound bag for potassium chloride (KCl).</p>
