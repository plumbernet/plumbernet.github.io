<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
