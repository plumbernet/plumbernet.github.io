<p>Have actually utilized Plumb Crazy on 3 various events, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were fantastic. They rapidly found the leak and repaired it without making a big mess.

<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your sink, shower, or bathtub) can be remedied quickly if the clog is easy and shallow. For many clogs you'll simply need a plunger, and sometimes some chemicals, but if this does not solve the issue then you may also have to contact a drain professional like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is likewise more difficult to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
