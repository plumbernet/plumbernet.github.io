<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- destructive.

Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is just recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (normally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
