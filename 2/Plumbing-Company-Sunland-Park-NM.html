<p>A cross-connection is any short-term or permanent connection between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Depending upon the size of your home, repiping may take anywhere from a number of days to a week. Generally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs complete water shut off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience very little disruption to your daily regimen. To start the repiping process, the plumbing team will first cover any carpet and furniture to protect them from dust and particles. They will then make small cuts in the wall and drywall to find the pipes and after that get rid of and replace them, leaving as much of the initial building product as possible undamaged.</p>
