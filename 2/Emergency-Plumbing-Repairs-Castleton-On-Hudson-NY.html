These particular heaters are extremely effective and cost effective. The main goal of most homeowners is to install water heating systems that will supply a stable and reliable  supply of hot water. Electric heaters can do simply that.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, dishwasher, and heater, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these small deposits are harmless, however gradually they build up and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
