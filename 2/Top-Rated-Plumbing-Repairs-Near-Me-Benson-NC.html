<p>This post intends to resolve the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: a correctly set up water softener does not make the cured water more destructive. Here are a couple of confusing truths that typically lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is normally destructive. For that reason, softened water must also be corrosive, right? This is a misconception because naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>
