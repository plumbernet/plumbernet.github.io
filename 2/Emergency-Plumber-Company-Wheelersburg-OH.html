<p>Our Water Softeners Are Remarkably Developed To Work.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot.

Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
