These water functions are considered a health risk if backflows take place from them.

<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your house. Then that usually indicates that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience obstructions in multiple drains at when in your home. This can happen in several areas and any combination of drains. For instance, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>The normal option is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.
