<p>When you've discovered the trip lever you want, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the correct method. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are prepared to connect your flapper, make certain you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
