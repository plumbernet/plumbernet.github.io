<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each component. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or constant) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
