<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Newport News VA</h3>
<p>Physical Damage: Water tank and water heater repair from physical damage such as cracks or leakages are likewise typical incidents. Kenny came out and did an incredible task unclogging my storm drain. He diagnosed the problem and was able to come back and jet it out. Saved me the time and money of ripping everything out and replacing it. He offered recommendations to help in the future, was very professional, and will be used once again if need be. Extremely recommended.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
