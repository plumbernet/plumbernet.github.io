<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair in Ligonier IN 46767</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, place a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make sure the drain compression seal is seated properly in the drain locknut, then reinstall and tighten up the drain locknut. Last but not least, switch on the water and test for leaks.</p>
<p>Are your plumbing pipes beginning to show indications of wear? We can repipe your whole pipe system, or repair specific areas in your house or office the same day. Similar to employing a plumber for basic repairs, you or your contractor ought to request evidence of a license and license number. Also verify that employees' settlement and liability insurance policies are active.</p>
<p>There are a large range of rates for garbage disposals and installation. As stated formerly, you made need a plumber and an electrician, to get it set up appropriately. Hourly rates will need to be added to the expense of the system, which can cost 10s to hundreds of dollars. While you do not wish to break your savings account on a garbage disposal, it is essential to spend enough cash to get an unit that meets your needs.</p>
