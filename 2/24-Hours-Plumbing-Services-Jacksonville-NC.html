<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Every day you count on your hot water heater more than you might even understand. From washing your face, brushing your teeth, and bathing, to doing kitchen tasks like washing dishes, hot water is a necessity. It can cause a substantial disturbance in your business operations if your water heating equipment stops working if you own a commercial property or company.</p>
