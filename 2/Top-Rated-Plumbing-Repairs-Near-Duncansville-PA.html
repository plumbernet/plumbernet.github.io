<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

Your home is over 10 years old, and you have actually never had the sewer and drain lines examined. Some plumbers may get professional discount rates from merchants or kitchen and bath display rooms. If you need a brand-new sink or faucet, compare their costs with what you can discover online or at home improvement shops. They might be getting you a better deal</p>
