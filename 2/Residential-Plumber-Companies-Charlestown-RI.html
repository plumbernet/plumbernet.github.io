<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Contractors in Charlestown</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is one of the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or broken, it could wreak unwelcome concerns on your home. A home's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the property owner is responsible for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
