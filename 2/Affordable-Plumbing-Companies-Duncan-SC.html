<h3>How To Deal With A Plumbing Emergency Duncan SC</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
