<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 different occasions, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were wonderful. They rapidly found the leak and repaired it without making a substantial mess. They, just like each person we have actually come across with Plumb Crazy, were courteous, prompt, and extremely educated. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anyone requiring either small or large job plumbing work.</p>
<p>The appropriate repair of a backflow preventer requires many products to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly should be examined. The installation must be examined to guarantee it does not prevent the operations of the assembly. Test data need to be accumulated to determine the workings of each component. The backflow prevention assembly should be taken apart and parts changed with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be tested again to be sure it was effectively fixed. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow chart is necessary to ensure it was fixed effectively. An appropriately repaired assembly ought to provide years of security.</p>
