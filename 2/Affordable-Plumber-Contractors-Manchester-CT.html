<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that should likewise be well maintained to help avoid leaks and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to solidify and break or simply be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the place.
