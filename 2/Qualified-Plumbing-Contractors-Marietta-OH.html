<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than removing the blockage with negative pressure, it actually pushes into the blockage, working even more into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>

Polyvinylchloride pipes or PVC pipes are frequently used for the main water system to your house along with the home sinks, toilet, and bathtub drain lines or vent stacks. Due to the strengths of PVC, it is among the most utilized plastics in the world.</p>
<p>The problem of leakage can be attributed to any number of factors which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, as well as poor maintenance. The hot water heater tank should have some room to represent the expansion that occurs when heating the water. The thermal growth needs to escape, thus the need for an expansion tank to help regulate the pressure. If the tank is old and worn out, the force exerted by the growth happening when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to break and begin leaking. The remedy for this is to replace the water heater system.</p>
