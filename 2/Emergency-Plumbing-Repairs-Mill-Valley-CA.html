<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it should be much less water.</p>

Rats and pests can easily squeeze through fractures and gaps in your sewer line and discover their way into your plumbing. These bugs can be really harmful to your health.
