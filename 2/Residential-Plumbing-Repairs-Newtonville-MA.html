<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet at Newtonville MA 02460</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the blockage with negative pressure, it really presses into the clog, working even more into where the blockage is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped suggestion helps require it further down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
