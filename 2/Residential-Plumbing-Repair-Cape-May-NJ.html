<p>Lots of bad things are being said on this post about liners. I discover that many old time plumbers are not informed on liners and have no idea on what they are stating. Will also state something does not work well simply since they do not like the technology and not because it doesn't work. If this heater is set up in a home with several restrooms, the piping procedure adds to the installation expenses.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
