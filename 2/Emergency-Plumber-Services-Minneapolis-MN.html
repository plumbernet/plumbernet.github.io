<p>All you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) as soon as you've discovered the trip lever you desire eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the appropriate method.
