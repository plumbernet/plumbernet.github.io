<p>Leaks are sneaky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften tough water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
