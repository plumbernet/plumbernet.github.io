<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. Due to the fact that they restore whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, normally restore after numerous gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a fluctuating water use schedule.</p>
