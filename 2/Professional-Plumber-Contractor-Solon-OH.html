Electric heaters can do simply that.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unfavorable turnaround of flow in a potable water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can just stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always stream toward the point of most affordable pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop.
