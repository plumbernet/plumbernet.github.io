<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Malvern AR 72104</h3>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that need to also be well maintained to assist prevent leakages and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to break and solidify or just be so crushed that it does not fill the space along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything remains in great shape.</p>
