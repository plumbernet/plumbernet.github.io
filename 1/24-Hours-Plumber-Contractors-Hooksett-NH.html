<p>Repipers start by covering floorings and furnishings to safeguard them from water damage and dust during the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings. They will just remove as much building product as necessary to reach, detach, and get rid of the old pipe and replace it with brand-new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling listed below it. You can arrange to have extra pipes put in at this time if you need to expand your water service for a remodel if you wish.</p>
