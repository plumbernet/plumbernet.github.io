For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from vehicle washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems might enter the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development may stream backwards into the potable water system.
