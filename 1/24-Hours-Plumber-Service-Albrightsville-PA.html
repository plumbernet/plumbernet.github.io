The largest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable coating, these are big underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.

If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Do you need a replacement for an older system that's ended up being bothersome, or just for a make over? How about for a building addition or significant remodel?
