<p>Think of all the locations water flows in and out of your home. These are the locations that a professional evaluation need to cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other appliances. Even your water lines must be covered. While your water heater and toilets will receive special attention, a skilled plumber wants to take a look at the total health of your system. That suggests testing for correct water pressure. After all, excessive pressure can damage your plumbing, and too little can leave your house with dysfunctional water devices.</p>
