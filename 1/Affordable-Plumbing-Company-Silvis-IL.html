<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of maintaining the integrity and performance of your kitchen.

<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the degree of the rot.

Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
