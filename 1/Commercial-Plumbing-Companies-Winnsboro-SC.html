Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow prevention assemblies have to be checked occasionally to ensure that they are operating properly. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have to be evaluated with effectively calibrated gauge equipment.</p>
