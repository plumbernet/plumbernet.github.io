<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be discovered near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Warning: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Due to the fact that copper is revealing does not suggest you do not have polybutylene pipes, simply. You may need to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>The typical option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.
