<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
