<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Cottage Grove MN</h3>
<p>Most houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather protection. As the external finishing of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks in Cottage Grove MN 55016?</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than removing the blockage with negative pressure, it actually presses into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps require it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
