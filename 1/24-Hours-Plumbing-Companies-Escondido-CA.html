<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or short-term connection in between a public water supply or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mainly time associated. If whatever is all set, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and therefore the overall costs. The majority of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with a lot of disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours total, making the labor expenses roughly $150.</p>
