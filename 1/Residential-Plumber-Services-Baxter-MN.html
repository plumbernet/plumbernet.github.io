<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in Baxter MN 56425</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>From below the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make certain the drain compression seal is seated properly in the drain locknut, then reinstall and tighten up the drain locknut. Lastly, switch on the water and test for leakages.</p>
<p>Roto-Rooter has remained in the drain cleaning business because 1935, when Samuel Blanc patented the first electric drain cleaning machine and established the very first Roto-Rooter franchise. Today, the technology hasn't changed much from Blanc's traditional invention, and uses blades to cut through debris to bring back appropriate water flow.</p>
