<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
