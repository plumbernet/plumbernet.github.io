<p>This article intends to attend to the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an appropriately set up water softener does not make the treated water more destructive. Here are a few complicated facts that frequently lead individuals to this incorrect conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is typically destructive.

<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is total.
