<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Pickerington OH 43147</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
