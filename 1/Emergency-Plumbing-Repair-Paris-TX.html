Since the source of leaking water can be hard to spot, our plumbers frequently carry out a color test to determine the source. Commonly, pipes or water service lines are changed, just to discover they were not the source of a leak. Suprisingly enough, sewer water is not always filthy or blemished and often gets mistaken for a water system line leak.</p>
