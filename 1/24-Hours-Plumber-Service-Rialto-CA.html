<p>While this may look like an issue with your faucet, it's typically triggered by something else - like a plumbing problem or issue with your hot water heater. More and more individuals are trading in their old water heaters for brand-new, tankless variations. Whether you're looking to increase your home's eco-friendliness or simply plain tired of running out of hot water, a tankless water heater could be the ideal option for you.</p>
