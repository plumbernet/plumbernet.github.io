Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very important part of the style of each component. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (instead of consistent or direct) of the element, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
