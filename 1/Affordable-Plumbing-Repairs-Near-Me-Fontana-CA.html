<p>A waste disposal unit fixes all of those problems, including convenience. Simply switch on water at the garbage and the sink disposal does the rest - and even more quietly than you believe.

<p>The usual solution is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.
