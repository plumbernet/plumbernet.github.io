The policy was not strictly implemented until a push in recent years by the DEP's Cross-Connection Control Program, an initiative that includes regular random inspections of New York City buildings to make sure they remain in compliance.</p>

The gas plumber will have a license that states she or he is licensed to work on and install gas lines. Homeowners should think about whether the plumber has a master plumbing license, which represents a high degree of experience, credentials and knowledge.</p>
<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, steamfitters, and pipefitters need to have the ability to raise and move heavy tools and materials. Tip: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are deteriorating gradually from the within. In many cases, repiping is your only practical choice.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of your home, repiping might take anywhere from a number of days to a week. Generally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs total water turned off while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience minimal disturbance to your daily routine. To start the repiping process, the plumbing group will initially cover any carpet and furniture to secure them from dust and debris. They will then make little cuts in the wall and drywall to locate the pipes and after that eliminate and replace them, leaving as much of the initial building material as possible intact.</p>
