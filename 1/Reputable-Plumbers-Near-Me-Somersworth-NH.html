<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Somersworth NH 03878?</h3>
<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth instantly begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regrowth normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
