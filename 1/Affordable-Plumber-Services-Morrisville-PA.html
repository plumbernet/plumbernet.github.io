<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular circulation direction within a piping system that is triggered by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Turn on the gas and inspect connections for leaks by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mix bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten up or reconnect joints that leak. Wipe the joints dry when ended up. Call the plumbing inspector to check over your work. Follow the how-to recommendations that accompanies the photos to make sure the connections are tight.</p>

<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and relies on a great balance of water pressure in order to work efficiently. If your showers end up being disappointing, or it seems little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it could be time for a sewer repair.
