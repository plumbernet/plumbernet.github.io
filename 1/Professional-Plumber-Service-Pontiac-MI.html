Because case, step from the downspout to the nearest manhole, and utilize an auger line at least that long to guarantee you're cleaning the whole pipe.

<p>Check to make certain it's not your waste disposal unit that's causing the issue. A clogged disposal can block the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then check it to make certain it's running properly. You may need to turn the switch found on the side or bottom of the system beneath the sink if the disposal has overheated.</p>
