<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Such prospective health risks are disconcerting, however they aren't the only issue. Backflow can also be exceptionally expensive to remediate. The Epa (EPA) states that the typical backflow incident takes almost 500 hours to fix at a cost of $14,800. Have you ever questioned what exactly is a water softener? After all, isn't all water soft? Fair point. However water softeners were developed to combat a remarkably common problem: hard water.</p>
<p>A 2nd part of the Battelle Research study compared detergent dose, water firmness, and washing temperature level to see if firmness had an impact on detergent cost savings. The research study included tests that eliminated challenging soils, in addition to assessing finding and shooting. Researchers found that softened water uses practically 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans up as well as water at 10 gpg hardness level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent savings rises to nearly 70%.</p>
