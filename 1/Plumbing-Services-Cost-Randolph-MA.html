<p>When you rely on Roto-Rooter for hot water heater replacement, repair or maintenance, you can expect professional service from experienced plumbing specialists. Backflow prevention devices run by permitting water to stream in only one direction. In an unguarded water service connection, potable water can stream both in and out of a structure or component. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a building for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw infected water backwards into the water supply. For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from car washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may go into the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development may stream in reverse into the potable water supply. To protect water quality, backflow defense is needed where the end user postures a danger of contaminating the city's water system.</p>
