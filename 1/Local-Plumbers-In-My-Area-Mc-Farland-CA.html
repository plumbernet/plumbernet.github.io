For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (usually salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
