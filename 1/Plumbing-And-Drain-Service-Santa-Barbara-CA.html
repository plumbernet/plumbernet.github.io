Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become useful to make until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a method to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe began to be produced in the 1940s and was in large use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics producers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The approach for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also established in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become progressively common, with a range of products and fittings employed.</p>
