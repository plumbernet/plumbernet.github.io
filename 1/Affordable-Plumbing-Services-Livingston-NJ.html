<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>

The essential for normal fire defense applications, DCVs feature an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, 2 individually operating spring-loaded check valves (usually inside a single valve body), 4 test dicks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade waste disposal unit start around $500-$ 2,500 and go up depending on size, brand and functions.</p>
