<p>Downspout Drains: These clog with leaves and particles and can fail to carry water from roofing gutters far from your house or company when not correctly maintained. Even if you take excellent care of your drains by covering them and preventing pouring any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, in some cases clogs are inevitable.
