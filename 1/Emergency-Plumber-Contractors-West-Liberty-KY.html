<p>In order to guarantee the correct operation of a backflow prevention assembly, it needs to be checked and certified upon installation and at least when a year thereafter if installed to protect form a health hazard circumstance. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water suppliers manage these state requirements.
