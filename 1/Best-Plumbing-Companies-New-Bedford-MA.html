<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber New Bedford MA</h3>

Got a little local plumber who overcharged me, I think. $212 with tax for installation just, incl. brand-new $25 strainer for the sink. Approximate. 1 hour work for two people.

<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause thousands of dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule. So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers handle all types of work. Their duties break out into 2 categories: Plumbers who manage basic repairs (frequently in emergency scenarios), and plumbers who concentrate on renovating tasks and additions.</p>
