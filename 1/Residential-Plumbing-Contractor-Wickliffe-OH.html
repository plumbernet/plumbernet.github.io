<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
