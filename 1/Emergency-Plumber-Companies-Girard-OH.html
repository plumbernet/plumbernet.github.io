Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>

Links that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
