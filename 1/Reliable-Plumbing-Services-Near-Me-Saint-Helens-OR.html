<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to avoid backflow. The basic means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The standard mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow.

<h3>Sewer Line Inspection in Saint Helens Oregon</h2>
<p>If the water heater leaks or burst, high water pressure likewise leads to thermal growth in water heaters which can lead to possible water damage.

When the piping in your house begins to reveal any of these signs of deterioration, you will undoubtedly need to repipe the whole plumbing system.</p>
