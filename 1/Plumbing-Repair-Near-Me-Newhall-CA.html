<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are primarily time related. If whatever is prepared, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or two of time.

The majority of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours total, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
