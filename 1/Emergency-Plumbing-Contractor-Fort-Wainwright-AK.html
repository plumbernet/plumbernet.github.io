<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Fort Wainwright AK</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper may need somewhat different actions than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, but possibilities are you'll find one of the exact same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
