<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service at Lawrence KS 66044?</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the marketplace and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
