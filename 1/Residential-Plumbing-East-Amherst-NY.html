<p>For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can trigger deterioration that blocks the line.

<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable.
