<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
