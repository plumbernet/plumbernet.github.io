<p>You discover rust in your water: If you start to see rust in your water, it might be an indication that you need pipe repair or drain repair services. Rust typically permeates into the water system when pipes have ended up being rusty. Although rust isn't inherently hazardous for your health, it can be an indication of problem to come.

And these differences determine the prospective need for backflow preventers.</p>
