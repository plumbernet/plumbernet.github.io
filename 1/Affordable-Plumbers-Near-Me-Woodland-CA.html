<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system.

The actions for changing a propane water heater are exactly the very same, and those for an electrical hot water heater are comparable. Recurring leaks and repairs.
