<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regenerate after so many gallons of water have actually been softened.
