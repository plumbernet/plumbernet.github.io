Undesirable odors are a direct result of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this build-up accumulates, it can lead to more powerful smells, and more serious piping issues. Without practical draining pipes, extreme pressure can cause your piping system to break and leak resulting in pricey water damage.</p>
<p>Inspect to make sure it's not your waste disposal unit that's causing the problem. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then inspect it to make certain it's running properly. You may need to flip the switch found on the side or bottom of the system beneath the sink if the disposal has overheated.</p>
