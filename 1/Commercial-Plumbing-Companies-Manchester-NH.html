<p>When compared to gas models, electric models are easier and cheaper to install as electricity is already readily available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be installed and a feasible source of gas developed. Another feature of an electrical hot water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated properly using vents and ducts in order to function correctly. With electrical designs, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows happen from them, these water functions are considered a health threat. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area must be indicated on construction strategies. Any backflow preventer set up on a water fountain or garden pond should be tested upon installation and then each year.</p>
