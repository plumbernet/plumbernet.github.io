Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
