<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Orchard Park NY</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>It's essential to be conscious that the majority of scale and mineral build-up in toilet bowls is triggered by difficult water if your issue is more associated to scale and mineral build-up. Tough water usually leaves lime and calcium buildup which can end up being quite unpleasant. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning approaches will definitely help, we highly suggest you look into installing a water softener to aid with your difficult water.</p>
