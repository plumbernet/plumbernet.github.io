<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and get rid of water particles from the solution with hardness ions.

The resulting soft water system is devoid of solidity ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
