Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the appropriate method. When you've secured the trip lever and are prepared to connect your flapper, make certain you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>

After that the softener can be disconnected, moved to its new area and positioned there.</p>
