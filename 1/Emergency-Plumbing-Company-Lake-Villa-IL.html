<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code, commonly referred to as "CALGreen" that was developed and mandated by the State to attain consistency amongst the different jurisdictions within the State; minimize the structure's energy and water usage; reduce waste; and decrease the carbon footprint. Continuous feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of garbage disposal, nevertheless, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal debris can often get caught in the blades. This can harm the blades and require repairs.</p>
