<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
