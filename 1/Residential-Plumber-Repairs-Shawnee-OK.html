<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from reversing in the opposite direction. You might be knowledgeable about galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, basically, the exact same thing, but without the zinc coating. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is suggested to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with wetness. While it does its task quite well, over time, it still does rust. This enables the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>An authorization is likewise needed to reconnect electric or gas service to a residence. If the utility has been shut off to a residential structure for 6 consecutive months, reconnect authorizations are required. The license cost is $99.00 which covers administrative and inspection expenses. An illustration should be sent that identifies the size and length of all piping if you are installing water or gas piping.

Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to provide one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed.
