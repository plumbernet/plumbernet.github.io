<p>With drain line cleaning, you understand your pipes are sparkly clean. With repairs, you know they remain in good condition. And with lining, you understand they'll be safe for many years to come. As a property owner or company owner, those peace of minds can be very, very great to hear. We service pipelines throughout the state of Georgia, from Atlanta to Athens, Savannah to Augusta, Macon to Marietta, GA, and beyond.</p>
<p>It doesn't always mean they need to be replaced if your pipes are older than these standards. Well-maintained pipes might last longer, and badly maintained ones or those in areas with hard water (suggesting it has high mineral material), may stop working quicker, states Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who supplied the life-span estimates.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To get rid of the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the big, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise until the system falls away. Get rid of the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
