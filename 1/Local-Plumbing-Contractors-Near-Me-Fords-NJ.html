<p>Specialty Salts: Different geographic areas have different water sources and mineral material. Diamond Crystal Â® items deal with particular problems such as iron concentration, rust stains and salt material. Not exactly sure whether or not you have a backflow prevention device installed? Usually, it's set up near your cooking stop and waste. David Davia is the Executive Vice President & CEO of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors.

<p>Hard water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the salt ions.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
