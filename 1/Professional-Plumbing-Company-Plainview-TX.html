<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each element. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
