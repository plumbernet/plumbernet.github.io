We have 300% more chemicals that go beyond national health standards, and a even high portion of contaminants in our water that the national average.

Researchers discovered that softened water uses almost 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans up as well as water at 10 gpg firmness level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent cost savings rises to almost 70%.</p>
