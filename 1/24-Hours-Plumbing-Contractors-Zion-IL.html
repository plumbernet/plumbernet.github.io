<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by energies or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and detach the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
