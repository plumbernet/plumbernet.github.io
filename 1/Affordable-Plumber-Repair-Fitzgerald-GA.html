<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
<p>Stegle states that when they are dealing with a client on a custom-made home, they will work directly with the homeowner when it concerns selecting faucets and other fixtures. As a subcontractor, those choices might have already been made. We have developed a group of contractors we've worked for in the past, and this has actually resulted in some business that has actually not included competitive bidding," Stegle says.</p>
