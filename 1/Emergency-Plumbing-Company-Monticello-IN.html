In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in homes were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs. Constant blockages: If the plunger has actually ended up being a regular component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Constant clogs suggest your toilet no longer has the power required to effectively get rid of waste with each flush.</p>
