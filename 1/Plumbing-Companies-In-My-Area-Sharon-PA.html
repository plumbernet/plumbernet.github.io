<p>Leak detection is a component of water conservation that counts on extremely technical know-how and specialized equipment to determine the location of leaks throughout the city's water distribution system and determine the place of those leaks at which visible water might or may not have surfaced. Water temperature problems can be repaired by changing the temperature on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be caused by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can simply loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can likewise be low.</p>
