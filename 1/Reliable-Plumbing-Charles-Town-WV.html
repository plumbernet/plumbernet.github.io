The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system.

<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Charles Town WV</h3>

Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an effectively functioning RPZ assembly to regularly discharge percentages of water.

Appropriate drainage should also be provided.</p>
