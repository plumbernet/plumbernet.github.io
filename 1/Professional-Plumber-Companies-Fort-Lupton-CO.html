<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Fort Lupton CO</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- generally salt. The result is water that's been successfully softened by getting rid of almost all traces of the minerals that constitute tough water.</p>
