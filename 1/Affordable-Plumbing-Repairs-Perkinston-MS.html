<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, normally regrow after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
