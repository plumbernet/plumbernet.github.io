<p>In water supply systems, water is usually kept at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might stop working or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Mayfield KY 42066</h3>
<p>When you remove the cap to flush out the valve, examine the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is easy and low-cost. However discovering the ideal washer may not be. The most common washers are typically available at home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be difficult to find. Eliminate it and take it to the shop to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers generally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
