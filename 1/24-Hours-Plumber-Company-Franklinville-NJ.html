<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular event, however it does happen more often than you believe! Typically it occurs at night when you do not see the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes building projects easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
