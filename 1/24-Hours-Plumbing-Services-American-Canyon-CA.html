Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content.

More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>
