When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If permitted to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the infected water to become a health risk.
