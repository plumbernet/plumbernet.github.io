<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Companies in Lake Orion</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is one of the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or damaged, it might wreak undesirable problems on your property. A home's service line (also called a sewer lateral) ranges from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the homeowner is accountable for keeping the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

Decreased pressure in the pipe might enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
