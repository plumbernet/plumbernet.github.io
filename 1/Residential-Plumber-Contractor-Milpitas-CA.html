Continuous feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal debris can often get captured in the blades. This can harm the blades and require repairs.</p>
