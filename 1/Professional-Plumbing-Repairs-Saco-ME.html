<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractors in Saco</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Video cameras are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing service. Figure out the size of the pipes in the home and around the house - they will help to identify the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be appropriate, the lines must be 3/4" to one inch straight from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in size to offer sufficient flow.</p>
<p>In order to prevent your drains from getting clogged in the future, pay attention to what is being cleaned down your system. Loss of hair when taking a shower is a basic concern when it comes to clogged drains in the bathroom, and pieces of food and grease are a common issue in the kitchen. When it comes to preventing beverage blockages and is for that reason highly advised, placing a catcher in all household drains will be incredibly helpful.</p>

<p>Tank to Tankless installation: If you're changing from a water tank to a tankless style, the installation procedure takes a bit longer. Additional time is needed to install new power and water lines and air vents. Later, the tankless unit should also be installed and connected. This sewer line repair option involves utilizing traditional repair approaches, more typically called trench repair methods.

The digging of this trench can be done manually or by utilizing a backhoe.</p>

<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if needed. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You may have to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
