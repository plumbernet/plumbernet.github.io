<p>Odd Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably needs a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to travel through.

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing.
