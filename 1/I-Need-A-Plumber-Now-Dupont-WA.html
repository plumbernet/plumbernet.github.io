<p>Odd Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably needs a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to travel through. Because of the tight area, the pipes often make strange gurgling noises as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe.

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it intends straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, check for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
