<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from reversing in the opposite instructions. You might be acquainted with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the same thing, however without the zinc coating.

This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi).

If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
