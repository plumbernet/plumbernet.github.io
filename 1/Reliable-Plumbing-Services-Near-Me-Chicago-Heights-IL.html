Appropriate drainage should likewise be provided.</p>

Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct way. When you've secured the trip lever and are ready to attach your flapper, make sure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
