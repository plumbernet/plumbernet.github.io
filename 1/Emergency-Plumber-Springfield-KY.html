<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
