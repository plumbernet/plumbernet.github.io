<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Bad Smells - If nasty smells are emerging from your drain, this is a clear sign your sink is not effectively draining pipes water. Undesirable stenches are a direct outcome of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this build-up builds up, it can cause stronger odors, and more serious piping problems. Without functional draining, extreme pressure can cause your piping system to break and leak resulting in expensive water damage.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
