<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Indianola IA 50125</h3>
<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and mixed with water. , if you prepare to drain your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
