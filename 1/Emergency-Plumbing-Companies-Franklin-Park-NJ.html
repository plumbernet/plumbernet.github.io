<p>Discover if there are any lead pipes in the house. Residences that were constructed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological contaminant (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based). You might not want to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>If you turn on your house's water spigots and water starts draining with a yellow-colored, reddish or brownish tint, that's a clear sign that rust or sediment has built up in your pipes and a repiping task needs to remain in your near future. State and local laws may impact the services this separately owned and run franchise place may perform at this time. Please contact the franchise place for additional details.</p>
