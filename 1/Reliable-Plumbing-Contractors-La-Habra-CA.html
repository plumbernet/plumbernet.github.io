<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless for the most part it must be much less water.</p>

After a couple of minutes, run warm thin down the drain. Inadequate or inaccessible cleanouts: No matter how efficient a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged at some point. When this occurs, homeowners and plumbers should have the ability to clean out their drainage pipes. Structures without adequate cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be quickly reached, are at danger of a pipe bursting.</p>
