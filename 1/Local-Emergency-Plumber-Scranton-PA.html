<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Scranton PA</h3>
<p>Is your water bad or stinky tasting? Is the water from your cold water tap warmer than you want to consume? A water purification system with chiller will offer you with cool, clean, tasty water for each glass. At Bonney Plumbing, we understand the enjoyment of a gratifying beverage of water. So, we concentrate on installation, repair and service of water filtration systems and chillers for any application.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
