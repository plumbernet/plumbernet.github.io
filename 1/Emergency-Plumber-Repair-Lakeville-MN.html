<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair expense may be in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800).
