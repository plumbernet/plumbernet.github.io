<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning team is happy to use Bio-Clean items for every single drain-cleaning task. Bio-Clean is an all-natural solution that's both safe to your plumbing and incredibly effective at eliminating grime, waste, and organic material that so typically blocks your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, rusting the sidewalls and only partially repairing the problem. Bio-Clean is a solution of live germs that actively seek out organic material and eat away at it, creating safe by-products of carbon dioxide, mineral, and water ash, all of which are quickly dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>Prior to installing, your professional will turn off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is gotten rid of and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is connected to its mount. In this technique, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get sped up.</p>
<p>With more than 50 years experience, our plumbers can handle any drain issue and leave your location in fantastic shape when the task is done. We pride ourselves on overall consumer care, from start to complete. Contact us today to see the difference employing among the highest rated plumbers in Los Angeles makes.
