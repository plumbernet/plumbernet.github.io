With time, the deposits build up, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes.

You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you desire to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
