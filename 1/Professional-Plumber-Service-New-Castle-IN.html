<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing major and regular leaks, you could be in need of water line repiping. If you do have frequent leaks, we discover that repiping can really be the less expensive and much better long-term solution.</p>
