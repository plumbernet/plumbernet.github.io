Backflow prevention gadgets run by permitting water to flow in only one instructions. In an unprotected water service connection, potable water can flow both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a structure for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw infected water backwards into the water supply. For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from vehicle washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may go into the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray advancement may stream in reverse into the safe and clean water system.

In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically limit the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
