Call Roto-Rooter today to see if trenchless sewer line repairs are the best option for your house or business. The other difference in between constant feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals only crush the food in batches (thus the name)-- not simultaneously like a constant feed waste disposal unit.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can result in improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
