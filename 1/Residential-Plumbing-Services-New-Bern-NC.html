<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in New Bern NC 28562</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
