Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific new sinks, but these will be labeled to that impact. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will eject in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.
