<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and get rid of water particles from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is without firmness ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
