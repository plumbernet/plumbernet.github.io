<p>In water system systems, water is usually maintained at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
