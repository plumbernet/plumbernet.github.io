I WILL SUGGEST THEM 100% for any plumbing work. they are professinal on what they do.</p>
<p>Setting up a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will typically range from $300 to $800 depending on the length of the pipe required. If you're transforming your home to natural gas, or if the existing line is at capability, expect to spend $2,000 or more. New gas line expenses include device connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
<p>lowered pressure concept assemblies: These are typically used in industrial plants, medical facilities, morgues, chemical plants, watering systems, boilers, and fire sprinkler systems. Lowered pressure principle assemblies (RPs) secure versus back-pressure and back-siphonage of contaminants and toxins. The assembly is consisted of 2 internally filled, independently running check valves with a mechanically independent, hydraulically reliant relief valve in between them.</p>
