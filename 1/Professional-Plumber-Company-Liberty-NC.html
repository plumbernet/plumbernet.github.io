<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Liberty NC</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another common leak-prone area. These can also be hard to repair as they are typically situated behind the sink, in confined spaces. The very best method to tighten them is with a set of locking pliers. Wrenches use up too much area and need a large swing angle, which might be tough to get in small spaces.</p>
