<p>If you notice a smell or undesirable smell coming from your unit, which is not uncommon, consider investing in a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can leave.

To avoid leaks from springing during the installation procedure, turned off the water supply to your home. Make sure your hot water heater's supply of water is turned off, as is the electrical power going to the unit.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is undamaged and tight, without any indications of leakage, you can probably leave it in place.

<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by utilities or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
