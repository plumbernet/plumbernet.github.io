This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (normally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
