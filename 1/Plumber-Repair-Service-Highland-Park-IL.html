<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Highland Park IL 60035</h3>
<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that must also be well maintained to help prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to solidify and crack or just be so crushed that it does not fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape.</p>
