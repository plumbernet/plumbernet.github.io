<p>Replacing your flapper might require a little different steps than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, but opportunities are you'll find one of the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
