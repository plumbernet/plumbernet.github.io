<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
