Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
