<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby energies or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and detach the drainpipes. Then remove the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
