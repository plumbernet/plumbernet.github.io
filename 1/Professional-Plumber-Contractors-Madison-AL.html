<p>When you remove the cap to flush out the valve, examine the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is low-cost and simple. However discovering the best washer may not be. The most common washers are frequently readily available in the house centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be hard to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match. Plumbers normally replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
