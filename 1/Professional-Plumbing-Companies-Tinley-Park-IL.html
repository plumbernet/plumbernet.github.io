<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Tinley Park IL 60477</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>You also need to buy a backflow valve if you discover your water has an unusual circulation, taste, color or smell. A plumbing professional can determine whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the outcome of other problems in your home's plumbing system. More complicated issues with water temperature level or pressure may require replacing the hot water heater, which usually costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
<p>Difficult water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the salt ions.</p>
<p>Because 1998, we have been serving Southern California with industry-leading plumbing services varying from brand-new and renovate building projects to installation and repair residential services. A great deal of sink blockages that occur are much deeper than you might think, and the severity is so extreme that a typical store-bought drain cleaner or unscripted house drain cleaning remedy can not fix.</p>
