<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that should likewise be well preserved to help avoid leakages and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to break and solidify or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. We highly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
