<h3>How to Fix a Leaky Faucet from the Kitchen in South Berwick ME 03908</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

All backflow preventers must be checked annually by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report need to be provided to us.</p>
