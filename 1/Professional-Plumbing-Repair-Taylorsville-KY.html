<p>Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Throughout regrowth, the water softener will take the brine service into the softener tank and the ion exchange process occurs again, only this time in reverse. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.
