<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very important part of the design of each component. If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the part, which might cause the component to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
