<p>It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an effectively functioning RPZ assembly to periodically release percentages of water.

Appropriate drainage must also be provided.</p>
