<p>It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an effectively functioning RPZ assembly to periodically release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage must also be provided.</p>
