<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous decades, however steel eventually struggles with deterioration and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
