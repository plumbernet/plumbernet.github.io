<p>Difficult water use may impact the performance of household devices. When warmed, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A large scale buildup slows the heating process and requires more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large accumulations of mineral buildup will have a much shorter life span. Scale deposits likewise accumulate to plug plumbing components and develop in other appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashers, thus impacting their performance.</p>
<p>No homeowner wishes to deal with inefficient plumbing, particularly when it can cost thousands in repairs. Your houses plumbing goes beyond just the pipes inside your house to the main sewer line that connects to them. The majority of major plumbing problems normally occur on the main line, and it's best to prevent them as much as possible. Damaged sewer lines can lead to restrooms flooded with sewage, damaged pipes, and costly repairs.</p>

When it comes to the concern of tough water, a standard water softener in fact eliminates calcium, silica and magnesium ions, leaving it with little amounts of what is known as momentary solidity". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
