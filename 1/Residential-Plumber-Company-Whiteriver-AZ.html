<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
