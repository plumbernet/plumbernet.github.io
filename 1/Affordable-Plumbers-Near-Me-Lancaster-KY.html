When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>

Although any broken home appliance is frustrating to handle, the bright side is that setting up a replacement disposal will be less expensive than installing a new waste disposal unit in a sink that has never had one previously. Depending upon the pro you work with, it can be as much as half the rate.</p>
<p>Before setting up, your professional will turn off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is linked to its mount. In this method, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
