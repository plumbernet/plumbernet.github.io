<p>The key to the innovation is being able to manage both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby removing firmness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be personalized to your water requires. Your EcoWater Pro will evaluate your water to figure out the right water treatment for your house. Because the softener's salt water tank nests inside of the salt tank, a single tank or cabinet-style system requires less area.

<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.

Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
