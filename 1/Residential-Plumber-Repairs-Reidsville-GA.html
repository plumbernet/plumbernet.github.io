Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the appropriate method. When you've protected the trip lever and are ready to link your flapper, make sure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
