<p>Leakages are tricky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
