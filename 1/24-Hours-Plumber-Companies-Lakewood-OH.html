<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Lakewood OH</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of major surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing significant and frequent leaks, you could be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can actually be the cheaper and much better long-term solution if you do have regular leaks.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
