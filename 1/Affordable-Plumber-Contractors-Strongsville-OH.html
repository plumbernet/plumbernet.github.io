<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
