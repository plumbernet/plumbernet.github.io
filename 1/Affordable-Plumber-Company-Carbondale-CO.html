If a clogged storm drain is not addressed in a prompt manner, the chances are high that it will trigger extra damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
