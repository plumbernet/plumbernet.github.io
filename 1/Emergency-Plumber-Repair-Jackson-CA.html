Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
