<h3>Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Whitmore Lake MI 48189</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
