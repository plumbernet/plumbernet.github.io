<p>Backflow is bad news.

<h3>Some Effective Unclogging Strategies You Can Try at Chanute KS 66720</h3>

For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to crack and harden or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so used or rusty that they spring a leak. We highly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
