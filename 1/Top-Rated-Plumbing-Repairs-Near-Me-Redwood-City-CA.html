<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water.

So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
