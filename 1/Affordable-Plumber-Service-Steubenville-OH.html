<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Steubenville OH 43952</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
