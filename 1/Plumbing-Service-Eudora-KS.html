<p>When you've discovered the journey lever you desire, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right method.
