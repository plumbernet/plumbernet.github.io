<p>Plastic pipe remains in large use for domestic water system and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe.

PVC pipe began to be manufactured in the 1940s and remained in large use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe.
