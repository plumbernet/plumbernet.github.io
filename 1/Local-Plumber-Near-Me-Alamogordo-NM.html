<p>Physical strength. Steamfitters, plumbers, and pipefitters must have the ability to raise and move heavy tools and materials. Idea: Place a heavy things such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen up the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are weakening slowly from the within. For the most part, repiping is your only feasible alternative.</p>
