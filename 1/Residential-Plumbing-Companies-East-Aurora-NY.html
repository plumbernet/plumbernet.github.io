<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
