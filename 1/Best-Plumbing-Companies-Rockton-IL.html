<h3>Seven Signs You Need a Professional Sewer Cleaning in Rockton IL 61072</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>Replaced 50 gallon electric water heater, thermal growth tank, and pressure regulator valve. When the majority of people consider plumbers, they usually call them for water pipe issues. The natural gas plumber will have a license that states she or he is licensed to work on and install natural gas lines. Property owners must consider whether the plumber has a master plumbing license, which represents a high degree of experience, credentials and knowledge.</p>
