Backflow prevention gadgets run by permitting water to flow in just one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, drinkable water can stream both in and out of a building or fixture.

For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from car cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might go into the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might stream in reverse into the drinkable water system. To secure water quality, backflow protection is needed where the end user positions a risk of polluting the city's water supply.</p>
