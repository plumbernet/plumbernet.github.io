Repiping plumbing lines in your home is a big task - and it's a task you want to get right. But the series of plumbing pipe materials to select from can make it complicated.

This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure.

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure.
