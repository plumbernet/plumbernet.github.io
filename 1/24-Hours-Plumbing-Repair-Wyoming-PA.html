<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
