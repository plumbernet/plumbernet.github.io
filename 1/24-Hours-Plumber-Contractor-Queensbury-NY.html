<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Queensbury NY 12804</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water functions are thought about a health hazard if backflows happen from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place should be indicated on construction plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond must be evaluated upon installation and after that every year.</p>
