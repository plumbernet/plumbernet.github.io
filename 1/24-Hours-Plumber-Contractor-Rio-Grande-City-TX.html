A home's service line (also called a sewer lateral) runs from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the homeowner is responsible for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for preserving the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
