<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a serious public health risk if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up.

<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Willoughby OH</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. There is capacity for the contaminated water to end up being a health risk if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, in addition to checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- generally sodium. The outcome is water that's been efficiently softened by getting rid of almost all traces of the minerals that make up tough water.</p>
