Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them resembles a procedure used to clear particles from the side seamless gutter pipes on your home.</p>

The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.</p>
