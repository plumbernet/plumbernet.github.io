Water pressure may stop working or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is a suddenly high need on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
