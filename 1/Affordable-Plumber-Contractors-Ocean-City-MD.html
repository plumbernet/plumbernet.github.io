Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content.

More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can position problems.</p>
