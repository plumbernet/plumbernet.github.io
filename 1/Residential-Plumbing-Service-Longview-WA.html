<p>People who write these articles need to be considerate of the customer and the professional service provider. Don't do an oppression to these individuals by being so narrow minded in your suggestions. See all of the possibilities. Then compose a well notified article. When the FutureSoft water softener is installed, you will not have a slippery feel to the water as you would have with a salt-based water softener. This doesn't imply it's not working. FutureSoft is not adding any sodium to the water and is retaining the important, healthy minerals in your water.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
