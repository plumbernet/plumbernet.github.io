<p>Finally, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water streams at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if pricey) device is best utilized in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
