Besides being bad for the environment, it's typically smelly and typically uses plastic bags to carry the waste. Worse, food waste can ferment in landfills rather of breaking down.</p>

Pipe relining requires the work of a knowledgeable professional and is not a do-it-yourself job. For more information on sewer pipe replacement options, call your local Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Drain Service professional today.</p>
<p>To make positioning a toilet much easier, new toilet bolts are extra long. That suggests you need to cut off the extending ends later on with a hacksaw.
