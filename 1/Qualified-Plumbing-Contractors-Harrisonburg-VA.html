Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, however opportunities are you'll locate among the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
