<p>A sewer leak on your drain line, or main sewer line, can be difficult to find and can likewise harm your home. Standing or ponding water from leaking sewer lines are also a health hazard and regularly go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can likewise undermine your drain system and cause separations. Our plumbers typically perform a dye test to identify the source because the source of leaking water can be difficult to find.
