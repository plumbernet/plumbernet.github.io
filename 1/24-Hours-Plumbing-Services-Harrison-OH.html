It is never advised that you attempt to replace a gas or electrical hot water heater if you are not particularly trained to do so. Improper installation of hot water heater may trigger fire or surge.</p>
<p>Corrosion: The most common problem is corrosion in the tank and pipes that connect to your water heater. This is particularly real if you have untreated hard water, which contains severe minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the product with time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another element that is triggering the deterioration, you will ultimately experience a leak in your hot water heater that is hard to repair. Leakages typically imply a new unit replacement is in order.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
