It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system.

When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
