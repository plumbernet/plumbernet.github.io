<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a versatile water supply line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
