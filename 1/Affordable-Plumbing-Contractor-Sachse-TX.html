<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Sachse TX 75048</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is just recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (generally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
