<p>Some jurisdictions likewise permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>The kind of backflow preventer used in a scenario depends on the level of risk and the type of backflow which could take place. However, garbage disposals that are over ten years old and often breaking down will need to be replaced. In older units, problems are most likely to return in spite of repair.
