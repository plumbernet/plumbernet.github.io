<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your hot water heater installation visit. Installing gas lines can bring a brand-new level of service. As difficult water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside bring in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause tough water stick to the beads, and the treated water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Remove all parts of the disposer kit from package, and organize the contents. Get rid of the P-trap and existing drain basket assembly thoroughly from the sink (Images 1 and 2). Place a big pan listed below the sink to catch water that may spill when you detach the drain, and keep a towel nearby to tidy up spills.
