<p>Backflow is bad news. After an inspection has been set up utilizing the Permits and Inspections Online Permitting Service scheduling system, inspectors may be called in between 8:00 am - 9:00 am the day of the inspection.

Plumbing strategies are not required for one- and two-family homes or townhouses, as defined in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
