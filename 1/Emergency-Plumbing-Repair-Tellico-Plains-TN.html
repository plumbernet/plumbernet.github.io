<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Tellico Plains TN</h3>
<p>Many homes or structures that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition protection. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

<p>2 styles of PVBs are readily available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. A PVB may be utilized to separate health or non-health risks but works versus back-siphonage only.</p>

<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some houses were permitted to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of one or more toilets in the house.

We'll send out an experienced professional to your house when you call Pratt Plumbing. He or she will treat you with the utmost regard and courtesy.
