<p>Older plumbing systems may have pipes that rust with time, resulting in leakages or other problems. Additionally, rust or other buildups in the pipes can restrict air flow and make it difficult to utilize several of your gas-powered home appliances like the clothing dryer or stove.

<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to detect.</p>
