<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Wharton TX 77488</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
