These gadgets are often combined into single items to increase their effectiveness, such as double check valve assemblies (consisting of two consecutive independent check valves (DCVA)) and Reverse-pressure principle backflow preventers (two inline check valves with a pressure relief valve situated between them to discard out any backflow water (RPD)).</p>
