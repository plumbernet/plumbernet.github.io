The LADBS application must be filed and paid for a minimum of two (2) business days prior to the date of the occasion, AND, after you have acquired all other needed approvals or clearances from all other companies. Garbage disposals can be made of either aluminum or stainless steel. Aluminum is more economical however more susceptible to leaking and corrosion. Stainless steel blades are also more durable.

<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, referred to as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house. Plumbers can replace or fix blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them operating correctly. Leaking pipes can affect your indoor air quality. If a repipe in Brenham is right for you, call today at (979) 200-6674 to have your plumbing inspected and we will let you understand.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
