<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>
