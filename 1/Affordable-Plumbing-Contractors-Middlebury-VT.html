<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
