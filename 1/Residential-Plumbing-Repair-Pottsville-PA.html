Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might have to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
