<p>List prices for home water softeners might vary from around $400 to $2,700, depending upon the size and type of softener. Softeners are ranked by the total number of grains the system can remove before being charged.

<p>The list of things a food disposer can consume is fairly brief. Soft or crisp foods are fine, however tough or stringy foods can be trouble. Disposers can be stopped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, in addition to the typical kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, scouring pads and twist-ties. While some older houses might not have backflow preventers, all more recent homes are required to have them. Doug's can help you find and recognize them if you're not sure what kind of backflow preventers are used in your home or business. We can also perform your yearly backflow inspections.</p>

One way to test for any leaks in your plumbing is to switch off all water appliances in the house and outdoors (sprinklers, hoses, etc.). Then locate and see the numbers on your house's water meter. You have a leak if the numbers go up after 20-30 minutes. And the faster those numbers increase, the bigger the leak.</p>
<p>There are more than 17,000 backflow prevention assemblies on water services in our service area. The California Department of Health Services requires each of these assemblies to be evaluated each year.

<p>Physical Damage: Water tank and hot water heater repair from physical damage such as leaks or cracks are also typical events. Kenny came out and did an unbelievable task unclogging my storm drain.

So we recommend installing or fixing water pressure regulators to protect your whole house.</p>
