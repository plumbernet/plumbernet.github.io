<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits collect, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
