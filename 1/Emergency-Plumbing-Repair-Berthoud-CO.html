<p>Recent Review: A journeyman plumber and his assistant arrived during the appointed period. They disconnected the sinks, cleaned up and advised a tool to be used in the future.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous decades, but steel eventually suffers from deterioration and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
