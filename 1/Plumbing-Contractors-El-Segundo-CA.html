<p>As soon as the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system.
