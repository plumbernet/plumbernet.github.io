<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet at Jenison MI 49428</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
