<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no nearby utilities or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.

Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
