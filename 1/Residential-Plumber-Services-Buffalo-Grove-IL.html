<p>Do you prepare to utilize fertigation (fertilizer injected into the watering water), apply fertilizer, pesticides (such as for bug control), or use anything aside from distilled water utilizing your watering system? This includes items labeled as natural", natural", and safe". This likewise includes the safe" mosquito control items used by sprinklers and misters.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
