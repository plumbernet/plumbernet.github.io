Some hard water problems are extremely visible, like sprayers and dispensers ending up being clogged.

Clogged fixtures trigger replacement or reconditioning expenses and can irritate your customers. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy expenses, and prematurely damaged RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement costs. Soon, these little costs can add up to make a real effect on your bottom line.</p>

Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can in fact trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
