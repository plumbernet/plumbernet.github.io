The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline.

If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the element, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities.

At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
