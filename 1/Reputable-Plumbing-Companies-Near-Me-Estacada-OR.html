<p>Lastly, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 individually running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best utilized in crucial locations where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
