<p>It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a correctly operating RPZ assembly to occasionally release percentages of water.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
