Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each component. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than steady or direct) of the part, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities.
