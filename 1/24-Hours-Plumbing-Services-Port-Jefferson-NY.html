<p>Swimming pools of septic waste. One of the more obvious outdoor signs is if you can see sewage pooling in your lawn. If your lawn smells foul and there's a puddle that just will not go away, the problem might be a split main sewer line.

<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some houses were permitted to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of several toilets in the house. Generally, the water system to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each usage, fresh water was presented into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you desire to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
