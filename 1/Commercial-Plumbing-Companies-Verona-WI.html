<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic system from your house. Then that typically indicates that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience obstructions in numerous drains at once in your home. This can happen in several places and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
