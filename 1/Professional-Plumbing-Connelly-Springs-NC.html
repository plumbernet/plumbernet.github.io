The immediate advantage to this is superior schedule for houses and areas with higher requirements.

<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a feasible solution, specifically when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your house and household.</p>
