<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes.

You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you desire to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
