The cost of having pipes fixed or changed can differ greatly depending upon the location of the pipes, the real problem, and the question of changing or fixing; but usually, the cost to replace pipes is $80-$ 440 per hour or a repaired rate of about $222. While some separated leakages throughout your house from time to time are typical, you should be worried if repairing leaks has actually turned into one of your weekly tasks.
