During regeneration, salted water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>Some homeowners may think about water softeners as a luxury product, something that's great to have" however not entirely essential. However, tough water can trigger everything from small annoyances, like spots on meals or soap residue, to significant problems like a shorter life-span for your hot water heater, dishwasher, and other necessary home appliances. For these reasons and others, a water softener can be an useful financial investment for your home.</p>
