This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>DCVs are specifically developed to avoid backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The mainstay for typical fire security applications, DCVs feature an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, 2 independently operating spring-loaded check valves (usually inside a single valve body), 4 test cocks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade garbage disposals start around $500-$ 2,500 and go up depending upon size, brand name and features.</p>
