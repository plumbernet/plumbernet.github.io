<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Lyons GA 30436!</h3>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration usually takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
