<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they degrade over decades.

After about fifty years, they'll begin to damage from deterioration and might put toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We advise changing the clay, iron, and steel pipes in your home.
