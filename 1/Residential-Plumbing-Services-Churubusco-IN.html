<p>When we handle your gas or gas pipe installation and gas pipe repair, you can relax and use your gas piping with no worry. While water overuse is a problem for your wallet, it's also a problem for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration process. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
