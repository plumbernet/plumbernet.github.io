<p>Lastly, the most sophisticated and complex backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five separately running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at style pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best used in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
