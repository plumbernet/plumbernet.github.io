When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
