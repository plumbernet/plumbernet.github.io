<h3>Do's And Don'ts Of Emergency Plumbing Troubles Maplewood NJ</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health hazard if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for effectiveness, as well as examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
