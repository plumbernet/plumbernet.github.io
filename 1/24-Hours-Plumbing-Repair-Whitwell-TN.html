There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure changes and disc compression that could lead to false data on the workings of the backflow prevention assembly.

The effects of raised temperature can also cause extreme pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the elements. These and other negative impacts from the hydraulic conditions need to be acknowledged and their cause corrected. The new parts can soon be made inoperative if parts are replaced and the hydraulic conditions are not remedied.</p>
