<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer calculates the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly starts. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regeneration typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Hard water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
