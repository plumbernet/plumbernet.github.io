<p>Last but not least, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five separately running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water flows at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if costly) device is best used in critical locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
