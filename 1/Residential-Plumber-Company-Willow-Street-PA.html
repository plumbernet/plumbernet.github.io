<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
