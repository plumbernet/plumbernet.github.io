<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced due to the fact that of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
