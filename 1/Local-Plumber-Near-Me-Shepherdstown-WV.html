<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return due to the fact that he had another consultation. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Installing the brand-new drain is a simple matter: First, create a snake out of plumber's putty and circle the drain from the top. Then install the leading half of the drain from the top, and screw the nut and mounting bracket on from below. Ensure to get rid of any excess plumber's putty using a putty knife. I recently needed to replace the water heater in my home and it was only 6 years old. Traditional hot water heater with a tank need to typically last 10 to 15 years. I likewise have a dishwasher in my kitchen that has actually not been utilized in more than two years. Washing meals is my least preferred task, particularly without the aid of a dishwasher.</p>
