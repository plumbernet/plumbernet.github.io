<h3>An Easy Approach To Find A Reliable Plumber Bowling Green OH</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
