<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>

<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each component. If the part is not fixed properly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
