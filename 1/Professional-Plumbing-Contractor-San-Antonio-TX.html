If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
