<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
