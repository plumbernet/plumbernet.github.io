<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a viable solution, particularly when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>
