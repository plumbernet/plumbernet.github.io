Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each component. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities.

Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
