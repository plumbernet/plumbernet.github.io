<h3>How to Repair Kitchen Faucets in Tomahawk WI 54487</h3>
<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and combined with water. , if you prepare to drain your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
