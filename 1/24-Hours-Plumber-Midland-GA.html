It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close appropriately.
