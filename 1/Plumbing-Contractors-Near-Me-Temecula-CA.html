The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped suggestion helps force it even more down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
<p>As we stated, a garbage disposal has a lifespan. Normally they will last in between 10 and twelve years.
