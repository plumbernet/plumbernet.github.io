For instance, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is a concern, you might need all of your water piping changed. Again, really pricey. This is just among lots of concerns that can emerge.</p>
<p>To connect a power cord to the new system, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires found inside with their counterparts in the cord, utilizing wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing strategies are not needed for one- and two-family dwellings or townhouses, as specified in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
