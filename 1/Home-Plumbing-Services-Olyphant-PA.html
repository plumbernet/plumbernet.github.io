<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Olyphant PA</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Do you need a replacement for an older unit that's become problematic, or just for a new look? How about for a structure addition or significant remodel? Once again, that's something you might do yourself, although it's normally better to employ a skilled sink plumber in the San Diego area. Installation includes over a dozen steps, and eliminating the old one involves even more operations. It can be tough comparing cut outs and component holes, and getting the new installation flat and level with everything sealed up.</p>
