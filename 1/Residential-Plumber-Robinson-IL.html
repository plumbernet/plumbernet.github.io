<p>It's Making sounds - As your water warms, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work harder and can develop sound. If your energy bills are increasing, a new, higher performance water heater can bring them pull back.

After that the softener can be disconnected, moved to its new location and positioned there.</p>
<p>Gas lines can be dangerous, and it's always best to take on any problems with the help of a professional. Homeowners must never attempt to fix a gas line on their own.
