<h3>Things To Know Before Hiring A Sewer Cleaning Company in West Chicago IL 60185</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the market and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>

And when you mess up a toilet installation, you can end up with huge problems: Leaks, messed up floors, moisture in floor substructures and walls-- pricey and serious problems. Unless you're really experienced, it's best to rely on a professional for changing a toilet.</p>
