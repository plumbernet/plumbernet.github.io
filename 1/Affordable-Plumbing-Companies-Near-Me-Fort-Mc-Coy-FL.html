Tough water destroys devices, leaves cloudy soap residue throughout bathrooms and kitchen areas, and dries out hair and skin.

A water softener conserves you from changing prematurely messed up water heaters, flaky faucet heads, and hours and hours of cleaning up soapy residue.

Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a fluctuating water use schedule.</p>
