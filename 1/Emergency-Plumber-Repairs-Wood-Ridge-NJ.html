<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite direction. You may be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the very same thing, but without the zinc finish. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is meant to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with moisture. While it does its task pretty well, over time, it still does rust. This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>Sewers, drains and waste piping are looked for proper grading to keep downward flow. The plumbing system is evaluated for leaks. We examine that the product utilized in the plumbing system is authorized by an acknowledged testing laboratory. We prohibit cross connections between safe water and water from a doubtful source and restrict the discharge of hazardous waste to the sewer system.
