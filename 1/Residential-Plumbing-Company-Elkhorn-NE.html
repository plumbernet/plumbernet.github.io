Some tough water problems are extremely visible, like sprayers and dispensers becoming clogged. Other problems can go undetected, like scale on water heater components and accumulation in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Noticeable or unnoticeable, these problems have real expenses related to them. Clogged components trigger replacement or reconditioning expenses and can irritate your clients.
