<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that impact. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will eject in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
<p>Setting up the brand-new drain is an easy matter: First, develop a snake out of plumber's putty and circle the drain from the top.

I recently had to replace the hot water heater in my home and it was only 6 years old. Standard hot water heater with a tank must generally last 10 to 15 years.
