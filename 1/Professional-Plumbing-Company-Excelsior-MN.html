<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have moderately tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
