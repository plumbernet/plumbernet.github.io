<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair San Dimas CA</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Another way to deal with a clog is by utilizing a chemical cleaning product or if you fear they may be too severe on your pipes, you can try old natural home remedy like hot water, vinegar, and baking soda. If you've attempted everything and the clog stays, call Plumb Perfect Plumbing and ask about our clogged toilet repair service. With copper water piping your water will be cleaner and circulation faster. Copper water piping never ever blocks or corrodes up internally.
