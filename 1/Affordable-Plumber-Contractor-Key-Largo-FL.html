<p>Consider all the areas water flows in and out of your home. These are the locations that a professional assessment need to cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other home appliances. Even your water lines need to be covered. While your water heater and toilets will receive special attention, a skilled plumber wants to take a look at the complete health of your system. That implies testing for appropriate water pressure. After all, too much pressure can damage your plumbing, and too little can leave your home with inefficient water appliances.</p>

Leaving the bolts uncut until you've done these last checks lets you quickly reset the toilet and get rid of if you discover any problems.</p>
