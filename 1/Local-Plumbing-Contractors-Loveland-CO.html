<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. Polyethylene piping also produces a fast and efficient  replacement job.

This allows us to end up a water repiping job in just one day-- you're never without water for long when you select our professional plumbers.</p>
<p>This is especially true of older homes or organisation residential or commercial properties. If your pipes haven't been repaired, replaced, or examined in over a year, then you need to call us quite soon. Regular maintenance is a vital part of keeping your plumbing running smoothly. Regular maintenance can help extend the life-span of your plumbing, fixtures, and pipes possibly by years.</p>

<p>A professional inspection of your pipes is required to determine if they need to be changed. The area of the majority of your plumbing pipes can make visual inspection difficult because they are located behind walls or underground. We use live video camera inspection devices to evaluate your pipes and identify the condition. We will describe the results of the inspection and the work that needs to be done.</p>
<p>Gas line leaks are a major security concern. Don't take any opportunities. Ensure the softener is set to the hardness of your water system.

<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET offered by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We recommend, as a lot of plumbers do, to utilize disposals moderately. Correct care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
