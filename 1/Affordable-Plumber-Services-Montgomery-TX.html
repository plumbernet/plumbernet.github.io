<p>The quality of your house's WATER matters. You don't want to fret about the issues of hard water, and with NuvoH2O, you no longer need to! Our tankless, natural citric acid water softener is the best-rated, salt-free water softener on the market-- that's why companies like Walgreens, HGTV, Popular Science, Panda Express, and more trust us to soften their water.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
