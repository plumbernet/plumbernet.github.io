<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is just recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically salt or often potassium).</p>

This makes construction tasks quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical cause of backflow.
