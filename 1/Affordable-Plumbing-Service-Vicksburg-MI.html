Some components may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each element. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the component, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities.

Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
