<p>It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an appropriately operating RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas subject to water damage. Adequate drainage needs to also be supplied.</p>
