<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and eliminate water particles from the solution with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is devoid of hardness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
