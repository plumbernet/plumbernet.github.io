<p>The issue of leak can be attributed to any number of elements which can vary from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, along with poor maintenance. The hot water heater tank should have some room to represent the expansion that takes place when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to leave, hence the need for an expansion tank to help regulate the pressure. The force put in by the expansion taking place when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to crack and start leaking if the tank is old and used out. The treatment for this is to replace the hot water heater system.</p>
