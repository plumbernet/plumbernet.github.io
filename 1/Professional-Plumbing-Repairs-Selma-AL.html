Backflow prevention devices operate by enabling water to flow in only one direction. In an unprotected water service connection, safe and clean water can flow both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a building for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw contaminated water in reverse into the water supply. For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from vehicle cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems might get in the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might flow in reverse into the drinkable water supply.
