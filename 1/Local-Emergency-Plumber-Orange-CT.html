Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular incident, but it does happen regularly than you believe! When you do not notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, often it happens at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire engine use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>If you switch on your home's water spigots and water begins flowing out with a yellowish, brownish or reddish tint, that's a clear sign that rust or sediment has developed in your pipes and a repiping job needs to be in your future.
