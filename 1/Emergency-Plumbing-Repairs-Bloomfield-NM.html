<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
