<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
