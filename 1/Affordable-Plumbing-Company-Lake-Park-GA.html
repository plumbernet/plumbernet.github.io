<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet in Lake Park GA 31636</h3>
<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and blended with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>

<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
