Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced due to the fact that of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.

So we recommend repairing or setting up water pressure regulators to secure your whole house.</p>
