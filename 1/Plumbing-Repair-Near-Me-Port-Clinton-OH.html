<p>2 - This step reduces calcium, magnesium, carbonate hardness, sulfate, nitrate and chloride, where CO2 forms as response product, which is gotten rid of from the water in the downstream degasifier (2 ). Inspections will not be carried out on Monday, June 15, 2020 due to an all-day training workshop for Public Health plumbing and gas piping inspectors. Inspection services will resume on June 16, 2020.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it should be much less water.</p>
<p>Hard water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
