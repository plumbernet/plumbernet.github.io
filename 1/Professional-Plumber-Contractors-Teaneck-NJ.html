Inappropriate maintenance such as failure to replace filters or media at the suitable time will be evaluated as "disregard".

<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic system from your house. Then that normally indicates that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience obstructions in multiple drains at once in your home. This can take place in multiple places and any mix of drains. For example, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of mixes of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from several drain lines in your house.</p>

Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
