<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
