It prevails for household drains to become clogged with hair, food particles, grease, cleaning agents, and other accumulations.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
