<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, however prevents it from going backwards in the opposite direction. You may be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the very same thing, however without the zinc covering. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is implied to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with moisture. While it does its job pretty well, over time, it still does wear away. This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>. Leaking Joints: The seals in between pipes have decayed or broken, permitting water to escape into the ground surrounding the pipes. Quail Plumbing installs all types of lp systems.
