<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (normally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically begins. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts need to be eliminated and replaced with new rubber parts. It is very important that only initial factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
