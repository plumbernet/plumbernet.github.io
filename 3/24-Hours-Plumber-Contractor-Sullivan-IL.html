Whether you're aiming to increase your house's eco-friendliness or just plain tired of lacking hot water, a tankless hot water heater might be the ideal option for you.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by continually bringing tanks off-line and on-line in reaction to the water needs of your carwash.

However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
