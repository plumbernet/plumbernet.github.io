<p>Water softeners add worth to your operation by safeguarding your water-using equipment from poor performance and early failure. Some hard water problems are really visible, like sprayers and dispensers ending up being clogged. Other problems can go unnoticed, like scale on water heater aspects and accumulation in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Undetectable or visible, these problems have genuine costs related to them. Clogged fixtures cause replacement or refurbishing expenses and can frustrate your customers. Scale buildup in your hot water heater will inflate your energy bills, and prematurely harmed RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement expenses.

This is a misconception because naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>
