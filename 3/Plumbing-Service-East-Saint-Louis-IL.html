<h3>Water Leak Repair in East Saint Louis Illinois</h2>

<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and rotate the large, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise up until the system falls away. Eliminate the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
