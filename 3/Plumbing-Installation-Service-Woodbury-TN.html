When you offer us a call you can rest assured that your toilet is in excellent hands. With over 40 years of plumbing experience under our belt, there isn't much that we haven't seen and that we do not understand how to repair or replace properly.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these little deposits are safe, but in time they build up and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water circulation, which puts unnecessary pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
