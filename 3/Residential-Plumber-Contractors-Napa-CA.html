<p>In some cases you have to replace a sink-- when an enamel sink is seriously harmed, or when any sink is leaking. And in some cases you're just prepared for a kitchen upgrade. If you desire one or more sinks in your house to  have soft water for simpler dish washing, under-sink and counter top softeners can assist. These localized softeners are easy to install and generally affordable, though you'll need to budget for replacement filters.</p>
<p>Pro Suggestion: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet up until the plug is broken off; recover the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
