<p>We're replacing a gas water heater in our presentation. The steps for changing a lp hot water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electric hot water heater are comparable. Recurring leaks and repairs. If your water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its effectiveness; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run. As a result, we advise changing your system if it is over 10 years old.</p>
