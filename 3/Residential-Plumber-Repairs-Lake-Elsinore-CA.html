They must be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must likewise be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet).
