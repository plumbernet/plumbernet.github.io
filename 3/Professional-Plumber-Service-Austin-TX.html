Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
