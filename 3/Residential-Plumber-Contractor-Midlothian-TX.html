<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and meet our stiff trust accreditation requirements.

Damaged and rusted parts make repairs expensive and tough, meaning a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the right fix for issues such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small parts of the entire component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>
