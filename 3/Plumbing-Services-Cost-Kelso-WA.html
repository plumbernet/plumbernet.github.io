<p>Downsides to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
<p>Mold Development: Mold development is another unfortunate adverse effects if you need a sewer line repaired. When you also have an odor of sewage along with it, this is most common. The mold growth would probably be behind your walls but will start to seep through in time. You will probably see a white residue on your wall near an area where a sewer pipe is located.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no nearby energies or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.

Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
