<p>EcoWater's elite water softener system is our conditioner, readily available in a single-tank "cabinet" style. It is extremely suggested for either community or well water products. No one wishes to walk into a bathroom or a kitchen and discover a sink filled with black gunk. We need our faucets and sinks to be working appropriately in order to maintain safe and hygienic living conditions as well.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and online in response to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
