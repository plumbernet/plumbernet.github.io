<h3>Need An Emergency Plumber Bellwood IL</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
