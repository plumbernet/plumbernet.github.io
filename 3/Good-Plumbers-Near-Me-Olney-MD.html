<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. No hot water in your house? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these problems, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs or perhaps a replacement. While a few of these concerns can be credited to normal wear and tear or incorrect installation, sometimes your waste disposal unit becomes damaged by products that shouldn't be run through it.</p>
<p>A lot of sink problems are repairable. If a sink is properly looked after, it can last for years and may just need replacement once a kitchen is refurbished. Nevertheless, some circumstances require a sink to be replaced. If it doesn't hamper the functionality of a sink, cosmetic damage is appropriate. Nevertheless, damage such as deep fractures may need a sink replacement.</p>
