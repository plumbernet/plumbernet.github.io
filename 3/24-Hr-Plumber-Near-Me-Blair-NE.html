<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
