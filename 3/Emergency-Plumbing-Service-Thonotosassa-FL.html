That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden hose pipes: The highly poisonous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply. An extermination company staff member had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other connected to an external home hose bibb (outside spigot). When the water supply system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through your house into the water supply.</p>

<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it should be much less water.</p>
