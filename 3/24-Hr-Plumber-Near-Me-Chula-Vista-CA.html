<p>Leaks are sly. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>

So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it should be much less water.</p>
