<p>Leaks are sly. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>A sewer leak on your drain line, or main sewer line, can be hard to detect and can likewise harm your residential or commercial property. Standing or ponding water from leaking sewer lines are also a health hazard and regularly go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also undermine your drain system and trigger separations.

<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off.

The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it should be much less water.</p>
