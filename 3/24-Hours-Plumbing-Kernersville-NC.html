<p>You may have heard stories about a warm water heater taking off inside a home or company!

Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content.

Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
