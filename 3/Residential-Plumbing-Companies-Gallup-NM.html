Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline prior to the issue got worse. Waiting simply wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a really pricey alternative.</p>
