<p>When a big sufficient source of water has actually been determined and assessed, the 3rd major component of a supply of water system enters play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its customers. The largest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Normally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finish, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. The majority of big cities need a number of aqueducts supplying water from diverse and geographically separated sources.</p>
