<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Dunlap IL</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Thankfully this is a fairly inexpensive plumbing repair, and can help extend the life of your warm water heater.
