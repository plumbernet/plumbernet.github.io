<h3>Drain Pipe Repair in Springfield Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>The following info is meant to provide some guidance relating to hiring of contractors and installation of plumbing and gas piping. Working with an unregistered contractor or failure to acquire the needed construction licenses and required inspections is not only versus the law, however might present significant and possibly costly problems later.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>
