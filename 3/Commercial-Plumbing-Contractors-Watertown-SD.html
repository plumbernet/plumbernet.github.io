<p>Our staff offers services such as sewer line replacement, sewer line repair, sewer line cleaning and sewer line camera inspections.

Sewer lines can stop working due to ground moving, age, irregular temperatures or other things. Bottled water just does not determine up to receiving clean, crisp-tasting water right from your fridge door. RainSoft can deliver this benefit by plumbing your purifier to your water and ice dispensers.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
