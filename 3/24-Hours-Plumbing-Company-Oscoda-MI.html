<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
