<h3>When To Call A Plumber Greenville NC</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
