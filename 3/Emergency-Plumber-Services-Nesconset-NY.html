<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals.

That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
