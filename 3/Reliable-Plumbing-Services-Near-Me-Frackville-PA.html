<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged salt ions.

The water streams through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
