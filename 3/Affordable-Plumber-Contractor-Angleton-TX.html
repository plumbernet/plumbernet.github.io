We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and significant leakages.

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports.
