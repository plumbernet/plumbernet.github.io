<p>We're changing a natural gas hot water heater in our demonstration. The actions for changing a gas water heater are precisely the same, and those for an electrical water heater are similar. Repeating leaks and repairs. If your water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run.
