<h3>How To Avoid A Drain Plumbing Emergency Morton Grove IL</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Also referred to as cabling, we snake a coiled metal wire down the pipe while we rotate on our end to unclog drains. This approach works best for clearing out drains clogged with hair and particles, such as showers and sinks. Backflow is the flow of water in the incorrect direction from a consumer's water system into the public water supply. Backflow may be caused by back pressure or back siphonage.</p>
