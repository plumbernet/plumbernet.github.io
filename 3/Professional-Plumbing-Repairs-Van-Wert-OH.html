<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it actually pushes into the clog, working further into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped suggestion helps force it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are set up in large, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
