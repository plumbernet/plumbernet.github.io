<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Willows CA 95988</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
