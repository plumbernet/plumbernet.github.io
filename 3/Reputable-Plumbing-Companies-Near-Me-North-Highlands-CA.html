<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service in North Highlands CA 95660?</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
