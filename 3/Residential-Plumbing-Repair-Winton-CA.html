<p>Please let EBMUD know of any situation that may need a backflow device. In some cases conditions on homes change that may need a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with ingredients or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a hassle for your organisation, they can cause financial losses and in some circumstances can stop your company entirely. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be disastrous. Even in a little workplace the issues brought on by even small drain problems can trigger significant problems.</p>
<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mainly time related. If whatever is prepared, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and therefore the overall costs. The majority of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>
