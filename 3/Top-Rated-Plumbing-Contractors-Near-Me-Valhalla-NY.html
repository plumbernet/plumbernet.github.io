<p>A task of setting up that new toilet or trendy faucet ought to be a task for a licensed plumber with everything at his finger ideas to include his knowledge and experience.

<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair costs might be in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800).
