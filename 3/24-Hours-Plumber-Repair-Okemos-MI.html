<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Okemos MI 48864</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
