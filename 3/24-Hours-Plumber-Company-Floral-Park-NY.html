<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water features are thought about a health threat. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location should be shown on construction strategies. Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond need to be tested upon installation and after that yearly.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does occur more frequently than you believe! Often it takes place during the night when you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building projects easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
