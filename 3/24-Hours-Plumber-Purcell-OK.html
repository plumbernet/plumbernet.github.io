Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no way to supply one, then we examine to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up.
