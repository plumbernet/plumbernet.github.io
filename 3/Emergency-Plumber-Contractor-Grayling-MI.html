<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Grayling MI 49738</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

<p>You can utilize a wire coat hanger by straightening it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
