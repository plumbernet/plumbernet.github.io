Repairs are the proper fix for problems such as missing or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small components of the entire fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
