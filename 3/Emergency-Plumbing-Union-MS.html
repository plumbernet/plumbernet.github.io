<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Union MS 39365</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of removing the obstruction with negative pressure, it actually presses into the obstruction, working further into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps force it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
<p>If more restorations are preferred, such as setting up a tankless water heater or broadening the water supply to accommodate a remodel, this is when those additional changes will be made.
