<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
<p>If you're dealing with a reliable plumber in Utah, they will generally stand behind their work with an assurance.

When that occurs, you will probably need to call a plumber anyhow to fix your mistakes, and opportunities are they will cost more and be harder than if you had actually simply called a professional in the first place.</p>
