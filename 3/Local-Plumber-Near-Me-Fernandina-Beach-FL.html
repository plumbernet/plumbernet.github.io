It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system.

Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
