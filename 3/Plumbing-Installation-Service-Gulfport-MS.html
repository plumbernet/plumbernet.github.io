<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Gulfport MS 39503</h3>

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is just catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (normally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
