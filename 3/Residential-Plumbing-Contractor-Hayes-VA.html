<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very vital part of the style of each element. If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the element, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
