<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Washington MO</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Toilet repairs and replacements are a natural part of being a homeowner. If you wait too long to call a plumber for toilet repairs, you might sustain much more expensive property damage. Even a slow leak can damage your subfloors and floors - leading to significant repairs and even changing the entire floor.
