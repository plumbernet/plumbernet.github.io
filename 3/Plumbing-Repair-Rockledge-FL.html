<p>Every affordable buyer inspects at least a number of things before making a deposit on a home. As you may be aware that the water quality here is quite bad. However are you aware just how bad? Most of the Valley in reality has a few of the worst water in the nation. We rank 3rd for the absolute worst water in the country according to DailyFinance and the Environmental Working Group. Having bad water comes naturally, we do reside in a desert after all. In fact the water you shower with, brush your teeth, and even consume has a chlorine level that is perfect for swimming pools. We have 300% more chemicals that exceed nationwide health guidelines, and a even high percentage of pollutants in our water that the nationwide average. On top of that our typical water hardness level is in between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simpleness factors "very difficult water".</p>
<p>The anode rod in your water heater is designed to bring in corrosion-causing components in the water, helping to prevent the steel tank from rusting.

Wearing away pipes are most likely to spring a leak (if they haven't already) and need to be replaced as quickly as possible.</p>
