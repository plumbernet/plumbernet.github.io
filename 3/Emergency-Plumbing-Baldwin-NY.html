<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner set. The total repair costs might remain in the $300 range.

That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the brand-new heater.</p>
