<p>No other room in a home includes as many pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. We now have actually cleaned and checked the components parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their components, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now ready to start the re-assembly process. Some designs need the components to be gotten rid of in a specific order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a specific order. Numerous parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each element is returned into the body, it is essential to put them back in the proper place. It is also important that as they are put back into the body, that no contaminant is attached on the parts or accidentally put in the body. The elements need to be put so that the guides are able to preserve their designed tolerances.</p>

<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that result. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
