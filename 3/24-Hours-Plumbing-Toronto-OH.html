<p>Water softeners include value to your operation by securing your water-using devices from bad efficiency and early failure. Some hard water problems are very visible, like sprayers and dispensers ending up being clogged. Other problems can go undiscovered, like scale on water heater aspects and accumulation in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Unnoticeable or noticeable, these problems have real costs associated with them. Clogged fixtures cause replacement or reconditioning expenses and can irritate your clients. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy costs, and too soon harmed RO membranes will leave you with unnecessary replacement costs. Soon, these little expenses can amount to make a real influence on your bottom line.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- usually sodium. The result is water that's been successfully softened by eliminating nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute hard water.</p>
