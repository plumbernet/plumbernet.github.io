<h3>Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Takoma Park MD 20912</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continually bringing tanks online and off-line in action to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive design permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
