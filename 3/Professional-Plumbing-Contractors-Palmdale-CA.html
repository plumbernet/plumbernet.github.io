<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some houses were allowed to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of several toilets in the home. Normally, the water system to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
