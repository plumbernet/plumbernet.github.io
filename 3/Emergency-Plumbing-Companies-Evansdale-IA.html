<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Evansdale IA 50707</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I just recently had a number of plumbing leakages fixed and could not be happier with the prompt service I received from Parker and Sons. They are very knowledgeable, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would definitely advise them to my household and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
