<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow direction within a piping system that is brought on by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of regular circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>No homeowner wants to deal with dysfunctional plumbing, particularly when it can cost thousands in repairs. Your houses plumbing goes beyond just the pipes inside your home to the main sewer line that connects to them. The majority of major plumbing problems normally happen on the main line, and it's best to avoid them as much as possible. Harmed sewer lines can result in bathrooms flooded with sewage, busted pipes, and pricey repairs.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This activates the disc to open, permitting air to restore and enter the valve pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
