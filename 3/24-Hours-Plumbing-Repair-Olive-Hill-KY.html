<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Service in Olive Hill</h2>

<h3>Shower Valve Repair in Olive Hill Kentucky</h2>
<p>The sewer line in your house is a major part of your home's plumbing. Your sewer line becomes part of your water system that carries out all water and waste from your sinks, drains, and toilets. Keeping tabs on the status of your system is an important part of being a homeowner. Left ignored, sewer line problems can cost thousands of dollars in repairs and damage to your home.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
<p>House owners can practice preventive maintenance to avoid future drainage problems. When a. month, utilize a plunger in your shower and tub drains to remove any stuck-on particles. Put warm water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice and table salt in the waste disposal unit to remove grease. Another great technique is utilizing a drain strainer to stay out hair and soap scum from getting in your pipes.</p>
