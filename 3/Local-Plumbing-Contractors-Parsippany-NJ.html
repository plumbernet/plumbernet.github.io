We now have cleaned and examined the components parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their components, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now prepared to start the re-assembly procedure. Some designs need the components to be eliminated in a specific order. These assemblies will likewise need the re-assembly in a particular order. Many elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are exposed. As each component is returned into the body, it is necessary to put them back in the proper area. It is also crucial that as they are put back into the body, that no contaminant is attached on the elements or accidentally positioned in the body. The elements must be positioned so that the guides are able to maintain their designed tolerances.</p>
