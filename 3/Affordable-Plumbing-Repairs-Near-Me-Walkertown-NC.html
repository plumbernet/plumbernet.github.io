<p>Your disposer may come with a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, rather of the conventional plumber's putty as detailed below.

Now, there are numerous solutions to obstructions, depending upon the intensity of the obstruction.</p>
<p>Understand that a lot of kinds of disposals need a switch adjacent to the sink to control the outlet-- the electrician ought to wire for this, too.
