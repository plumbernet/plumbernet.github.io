Whether you're wanting to increase your home's eco-friendliness or just plain tired of lacking hot water, a tankless hot water heater could be the ideal service for you.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and on-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive design permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
