<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Mountain View HI 96771</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your water heater installation appointment. Installing gas lines can bring a new level of service. As difficult water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger hard water stick to the beads, and the cured water heads out into your house's plumbing system.</p>
<p>When soap combines with dissolved calcium and magnesium, scum occurs. Soap scum is tough to get rid of from sinks, showers, bath tubs and other home appliances. Galvanized steel pipes last from 20 to 50 years. To learn more about our Rancho Cucamonga tankless water heater installation services, contact us today!
