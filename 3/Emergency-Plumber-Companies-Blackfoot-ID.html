<p>These branching distribution pipelines form networks and loops including water mains and supply pipelines. Water mains vary in size from 6 inches, to 8, 10, 12, and 16 inches in diameter. The pipelines supply water for entire neighborhoods as well as large commercial, residential and commercial complexes.

<p>Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water solidity can be eliminated relatively easily by utilizing an ion exchange procedure. Basic water softeners are cation exchange gadgets.
