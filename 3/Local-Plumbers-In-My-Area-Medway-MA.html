<h3>Types Of Blocked Drain Cleaning Equipment in Medway MA 02053</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Typical enough that many people opt for do-it-yourself repairs. But often even determining the leak can be an issue. It could be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, garbage disposal fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
