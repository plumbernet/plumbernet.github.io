<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if needed. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may need to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>They were running a bit late due to earlier service calls, but I give the company props for contacting us to update us on the later arrival time. Some tasks take longer than expected, that's easy to understand, by keeping us notified of the minor delay, we didn't have to worry. We contacted Ron Steele Plumbing to install brand-new water supply and drain lines during our master bathroom remodeling task. Not only were they really affordable, however the professional service and quality installation surpassed our expectations.</p>
