<p>Our staff offers services such as sewer line replacement, sewer line repair, sewer line cleaning and sewer line camera inspections. Those services help you make certain that your home's plumbing system is operating at optimal performance.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can cause improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
