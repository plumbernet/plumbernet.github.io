Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the appropriate method. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are ready to hook up your flapper, make certain you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
