<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans.

Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
