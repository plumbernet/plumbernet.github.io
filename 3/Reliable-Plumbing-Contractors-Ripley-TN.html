<p>In water system systems, water is normally maintained at a considerable pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may stop working or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
