<p>No other room in a house consists of as numerous pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. Look for quality products when replacing an under-sink assembly. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, in addition to versatile rubber traps.

PVC assemblies are a good choice s they can be quickly attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
