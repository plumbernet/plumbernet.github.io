<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is without hardness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
