Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day.

This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
