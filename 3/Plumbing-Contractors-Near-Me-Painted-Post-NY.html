<p>The typical time to replace a garbage or install disposal ranges from 2 to 3 hours. A handyman charges $25 and $45 per hour while plumbers charge $45 and $100 per hour.

When the piping in your home starts to reveal any of these indications of corrosion, you will inevitably need to repipe the whole plumbing system.</p>
