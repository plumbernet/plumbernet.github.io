If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue.
