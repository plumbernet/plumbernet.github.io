<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
