For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is just catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
