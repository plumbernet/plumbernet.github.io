<p>In some neighborhoods, house water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to remove chloride. The chloride travels through the treatment plant and ends up in our streams and lakes. In homes with private wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic system and then ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals come with appliance wires connected, and others do not. If yours does not, remove the cover plate beneath the disposal and connect the wires according the producer's guidelines. Most standard disposals have you connect white wires to black wires and white wires to black wires. Screw the cover plate back on when you're finished.</p>
