<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and counts on an excellent balance of water pressure in order to work effectively. If your showers become disappointing, or it appears little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it could be time for a sewer repair. The cost depends on the size of the home and the variety of restrooms and plumbing fixtures-- laundry room, damp bar, mud room, etc. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to get to the plumbing will include $500 or more to your last costs.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
