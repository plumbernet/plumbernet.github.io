<p>106.2.2.1 Other than Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent rule exemptions in Area 106.2.2 will be applicable to minor repairs and replacement piping only.

Programs typically last 4 to 5 years and need apprentices to finish a specific number of on-the-job training and technical education hours each year.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does take place more often than you think! Frequently it occurs during the night when you don't discover the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes building tasks quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>
