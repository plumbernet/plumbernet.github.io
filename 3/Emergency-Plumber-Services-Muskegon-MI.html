These cameras are designed to go through twists and turns due to their bend, and their real-time transmission provides conclusive evidence of the problem. However, for drain line inspections, a plumbing camera will have trouble walking around a p-pipe drain. If you have any concerns, please call The Pipe Doctor.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more.
