<p>CPM Plumbing focuses on quick service, accurate troubleshooting, and precision repairs so your business never ever needs to experience downtime. If there is a leak, one thing to know about gas lines is they can be incredibly hazardous. While gas leaks are uncommon, you need to get out of the building immediately if you discover a smell like rotten eggs in your property. A gas leak can have nearly immediate impacts on those exposed to it, and it can even be fatal. If you have actually got a gas pipe leaking, leave the house and call us right away.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of flow in a potable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only flow in one instructions. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always stream toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The demand upstream might cause a reversal in flow.</p>
