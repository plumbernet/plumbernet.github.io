<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
