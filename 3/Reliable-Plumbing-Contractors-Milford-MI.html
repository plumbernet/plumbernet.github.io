<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
