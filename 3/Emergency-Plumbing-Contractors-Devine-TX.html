The best method to prevent drain blockages is to view what you flush. If you take a look at your house's plumbing pipes and see spots, discoloration, flaking, little indentations or rust, your pipes are corroding. Wearing away pipes are most likely to spring a leak (if they have not already) and should be changed as quickly as possible.</p>
