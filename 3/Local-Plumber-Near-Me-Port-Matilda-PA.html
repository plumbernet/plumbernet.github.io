<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Port Matilda PA</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Port Matilda PA 16870</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than removing the clog with unfavorable pressure, it really presses into the blockage, working even more into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
