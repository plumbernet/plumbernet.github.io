<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will accumulate in various parts of the plumbing system, many typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow issues or perhaps stop a fixture from streaming altogether.

Chances are good that the installing brackets on the new system will fit simply great. To find out, remove the old disposal and install the new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the new disposal using the old flange.</p>
