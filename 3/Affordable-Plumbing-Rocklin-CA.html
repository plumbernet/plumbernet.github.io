<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Rocklin CA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
