<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Palos Park IL 60464</h3>

<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
