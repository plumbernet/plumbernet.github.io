<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers must be able to raise and move heavy tools and materials. Tip: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are weakening gradually from the within. For the most part, repiping is your only viable choice.</p>
