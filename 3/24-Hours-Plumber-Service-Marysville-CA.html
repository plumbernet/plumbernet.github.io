<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
