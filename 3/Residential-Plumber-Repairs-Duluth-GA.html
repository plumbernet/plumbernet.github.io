<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
