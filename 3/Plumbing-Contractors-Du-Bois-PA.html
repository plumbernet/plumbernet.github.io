<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Du Bois PA</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water system line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
