<p>Your sewer line is one of the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or broken, it could wreak undesirable concerns on your property. A house's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) ranges from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the homeowner is responsible for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for keeping the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and eliminate water particles from the service with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
