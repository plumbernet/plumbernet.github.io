<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in various parts of the plumbing system, a lot of commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low circulation issues or even stop a fixture from flowing completely. The next common concern that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which occurs when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it lowers the available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
