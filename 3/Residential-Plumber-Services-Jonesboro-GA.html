<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement in Jonesboro Georgia</h2>
<p>In some communities, home water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to eliminate chloride. The chloride goes through the treatment plant and winds up in our streams and lakes. In houses with private wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic system and after that winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
