<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have moderately hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
