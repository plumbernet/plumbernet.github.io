<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Fall River MA</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
