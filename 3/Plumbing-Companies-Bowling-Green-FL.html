<h3>Heating, Cooling, Electrical And Plumbing Services Bowling Green FL</h3>
<p>A newly set up hot water heater must not produce unusual sounds, but it will begin to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder in time as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things worsen drastically for homes with a high need for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be essential.</p>
