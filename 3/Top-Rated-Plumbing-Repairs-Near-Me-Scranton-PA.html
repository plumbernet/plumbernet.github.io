<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Scranton PA 18504</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
