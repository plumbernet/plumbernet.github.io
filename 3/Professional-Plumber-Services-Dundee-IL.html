The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in diameter to supply appropriate circulation.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of flow in a potable water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can just stream in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly stream toward the point of most affordable pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The demand upstream could trigger a turnaround in flow.</p>
