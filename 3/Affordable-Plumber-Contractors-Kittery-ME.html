<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work harder and can create sound. If your energy bills are rising, a new, higher effectiveness water heater can bring them pull back. All that needs to be done is closing off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, enabling difficult water to stream to the storage tank and household taps.
