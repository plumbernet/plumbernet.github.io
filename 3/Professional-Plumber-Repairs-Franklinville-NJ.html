<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
