<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
