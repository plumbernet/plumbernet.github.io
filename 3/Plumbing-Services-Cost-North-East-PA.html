While water overuse is a problem for your wallet, it's likewise a problem for the environment.

That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>If you have a big bathtub or more that 2 bathrooms, this style water heater may make the most sense for you. There are some installation considerations, especially around sizing the gas line and setting up the flue vent, however with the ability for a 50-gallon tank to produce more hot water than a basic 80-gallon tank, these things are quite unique. High-efficiency storage is a terrific choice for area heating hydronic options too.</p>
