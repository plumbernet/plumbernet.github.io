<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
