No, it is not a regular incident, but it does take place regularly than you believe! Frequently it happens in the evening when you do not observe the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow.

This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
