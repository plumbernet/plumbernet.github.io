These sink switch packages are made to be quickly installed 1, and will typically take your plumber less than an hour to install, at average plumbing expenses of approximately $45-$ 65 per hour.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these little deposits are harmless, but with time they develop and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

In many cases, repiping is your only viable choice.</p>
