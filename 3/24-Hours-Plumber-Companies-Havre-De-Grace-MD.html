<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that need to likewise be well preserved to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and break or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
