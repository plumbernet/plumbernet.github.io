<p>Leakages are sly. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
