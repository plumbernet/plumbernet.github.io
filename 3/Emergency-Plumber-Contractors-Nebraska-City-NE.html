<p>Plastic pipe remains in broad usage for domestic supply of water and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being useful to produce up until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a method to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe began to be produced in the 1940s and remained in large use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The method for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also established in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become progressively typical, with a range of materials and fittings utilized.</p>
<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; recover the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
