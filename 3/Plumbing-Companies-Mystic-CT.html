If there was an existing disposal connected to the sink currently, it's most likely that the brand-new system will fit the existing bracket. If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in place-- start by eliminating the old drain. Most drains are attached to the sink by a big nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen.</p>
