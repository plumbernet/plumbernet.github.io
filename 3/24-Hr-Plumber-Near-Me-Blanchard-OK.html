Then that generally implies that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience clogs in multiple drains at once in your home. This can occur in several places and any combination of drains. For example, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous mixes of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your home.</p>
