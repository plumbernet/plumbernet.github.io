<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one instructions, however prevents it from reversing in the opposite instructions. You may be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, basically, the same thing, however without the zinc covering.

This enables the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
