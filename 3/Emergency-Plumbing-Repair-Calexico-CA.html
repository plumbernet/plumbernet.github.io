<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
<p>A. Check valve assembly backflow preventers are frequently discovered on water lines servicing fire lawn sprinkler, commercial swimming pools, water treatment tanks, among others. Local code will define what products in your area requires which specific type of backflow prevention device. Always consult your local code authorities with any questions relating to backflow prevention.</p>
