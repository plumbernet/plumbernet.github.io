<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe.
