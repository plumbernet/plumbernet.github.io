<p>If you have a dishwasher, or want to get one down the line, then ensure the waste disposal unit you put in has an attachment for this. This is a perfect variation as waste from the dishwasher can wash directly into the disposal system. Even if you do not have need for a dishwasher, if your house ever alters hands, new owners may value the alternative.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring.

Water softener systems use resin beads that bring in and connect salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps press hard water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
