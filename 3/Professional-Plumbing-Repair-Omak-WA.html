<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
