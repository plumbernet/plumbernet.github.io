The cost mainly depends on the toilet you choose if you need a new toilet. Toilets vary in style, flushing performance and bowl shape, all of that make some toilets more expensive than others. When installing a new toilet, the plumber might also need to make adjustments to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the overall cost of the job.</p>
