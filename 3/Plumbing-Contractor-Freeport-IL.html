Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>

<p>Changing your flapper might require somewhat different actions than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll locate among the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
