<p>Considering that 1980, backflow preventers have been legally mandated for particular structures by the New York Sanitary Code and the Guidelines of the City of New York. The guideline was not strictly imposed until a push in current years by the DEP's Cross-Connection Control Program, an initiative that consists of regular random inspections of New york city City buildings to make certain they are in compliance.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it need to be much less water.</p>
