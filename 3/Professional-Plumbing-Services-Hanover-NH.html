<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
