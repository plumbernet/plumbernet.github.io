If your energy expenses are rising, a new, higher performance water heater can bring them back down. All that needs to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, enabling difficult water to flow to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, transferred to its new location and put there.</p>
