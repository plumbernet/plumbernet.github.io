<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The irrigation backflow testing season is from May to September. Watering backflow prevention assemblies must be evaluated by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to make sure correct backflow prevention remains in location to safeguard our drinking water throughout the irrigation season. Denver Water will send out a testing pointer notification thirty days prior to the yearly test is due.</p>
<p>An authorization is also needed to reconnect electric or gas service to a residence. Reconnect permits are required if the utility has been shut off to a residential structure for 6 successive months. The authorization cost is $99.00 which covers administrative and inspection expenses. If you are installing water or gas piping, a drawing needs to be submitted that determines the size and length of all piping. Include the Gas Piping Design template found below with your application.</p>

<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite direction from its typical circulation. IRWD's safe and clean water supply is designed to keep the water flowing to you.

Every client who owns a backflow prevention assembly is required to have actually the assembly evaluated each year. When your backflow preventer was last tested and the outcome of your test, log into your Manatee County Utilities online account to find out.</p>

In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>
