<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless most of the times it need to be much less water.</p>
