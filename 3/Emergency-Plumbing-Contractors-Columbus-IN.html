<h3>Basement Plumbing in Columbus Indiana</h2>
<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they deteriorate over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are vulnerable to many different kinds of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll start to compromise from rust and may place toxins into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the clay, steel, and iron pipes in your house. This might not need completely repiping the house, since more recent materials might have currently been used in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you identify exactly what work requires to be done.</p>

The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
