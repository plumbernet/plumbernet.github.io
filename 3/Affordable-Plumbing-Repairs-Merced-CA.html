<p>The average cost of a batch feed garbage disposal is $100-$ 350 nationwide, depending upon the size and design. They are more secure to use than constant feed disposals, but are not recommended for households that produce a great deal of food waste. Instead of a switch, the batch feed garbage disposal is triggered by putting a stopper in the sink drain.</p>
<p>Before setting up, your professional will turn off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is gotten rid of and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a new installing ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is connected to its install.
