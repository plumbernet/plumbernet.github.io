<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Trumbull CT</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your lawn. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>

<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Trumbull CT 06611</h3>

The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
