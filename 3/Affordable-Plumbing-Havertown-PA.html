<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Contractor in Havertown</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being damaged or clogged, it could wreak undesirable issues on your residential or commercial property. A house's service line (also called a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the homeowner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>In order to avoid your drains from getting clogged in the future, pay very close attention to what is being cleaned down your system.

<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Havertown PA 19083</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the marketplace and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
