<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
