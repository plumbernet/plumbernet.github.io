<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is simply recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (usually salt or often potassium).</p>

You might have to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
