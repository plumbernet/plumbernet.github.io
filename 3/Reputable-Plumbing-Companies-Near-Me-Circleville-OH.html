<p>The anode rod in your hot water heater is designed to attract corrosion-causing aspects in the water, assisting to prevent the steel tank from corroding. The very best way to avoid drain blockages is to watch what you flush. If you take a look at your home's plumbing pipes and see spots, staining, flaking, small imprints or rust, your pipes are corroding. Corroding pipes are most likely to spring a leak (if they haven't already) and need to be replaced as quickly as possible.</p>
