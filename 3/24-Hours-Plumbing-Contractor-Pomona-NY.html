<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Pomona NY 10970</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
