<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the required instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water.
