<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
