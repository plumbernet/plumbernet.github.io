<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is one of the least costly backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health hazard conditions. They should be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local authorities, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only protect against back siphonage.</p>
