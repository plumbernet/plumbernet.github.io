Remember that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper way. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are prepared to attach your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
