<p>Please let EBMUD know of any situation that may need a backflow device. In some cases conditions on residential or commercial properties change that may require a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with additives or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a hassle for your organisation, they can trigger financial losses and in some circumstances can stop your company totally. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be disastrous. Even in a little office the concerns brought on by even little drain problems can trigger major concerns.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by utilities or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
