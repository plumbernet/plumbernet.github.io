<p>This is another mix that can deal with sink blockages. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mixture sit for a number of hours, then flush with boiling water. If it does not work the very first time, you can repeat this process.

It is more likely to be found in older homes built prior to the 1970s.</p>
