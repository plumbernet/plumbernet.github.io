<p>Roto-Rooter has actually been in the drain cleaning business since 1935, when Samuel Blanc patented the very first electric drain cleaning machine and established the very first Roto-Rooter franchise. Today, the innovation hasn't altered much from Blanc's classic innovation, and utilizes blades to cut through debris to restore correct water circulation.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
