Generally, minerals get there since groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants take a trip with the water up until it remains in your house. Water softening uses an ion exchange procedure to get rid of liquified minerals that aren't as efficiently eliminated by mechanical filtration. These materials are what triggers difficult water.</p>
