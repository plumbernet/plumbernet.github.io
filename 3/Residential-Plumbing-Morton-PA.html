<p>Sewer lines have one important function: carry wastewater out of a home or building. Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the problem became worse. Waiting simply wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely pricey alternative.</p>
<p>Most hot water heater are developed to last for 8-12 years and are a significant energy customer in your home.

<p>Finally, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best used in important locations where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
