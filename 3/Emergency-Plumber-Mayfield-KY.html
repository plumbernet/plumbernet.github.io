<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>

<p>This article aims to resolve the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes deterioration This is not the case: an appropriately configured water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a few confusing facts that often lead people to this incorrect conclusion. First, naturally soft water is usually corrosive. For that reason, softened water must also be destructive, ideal? This is a fallacy because naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>

Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
