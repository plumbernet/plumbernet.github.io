<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler generally are installed in locations where water might trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system.
