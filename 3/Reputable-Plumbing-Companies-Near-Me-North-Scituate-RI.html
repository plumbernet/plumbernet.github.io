It likewise stops big items from going into the disposal unit and prevents up sprinkling when the unit is on.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To eliminate the disposer, support it from below and rotate the large, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise up until the unit falls away.

<p>Difficult water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the salt ions.</p>
<p>Pro Suggestion: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the unit, now is the very best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; obtain the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
