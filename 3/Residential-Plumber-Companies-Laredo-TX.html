<h3>Leak Detection Services: Leave It to the Laredo TX 78046 Experts</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

Then they are changed in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
