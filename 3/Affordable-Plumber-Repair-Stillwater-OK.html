<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Stillwater OK 74074</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
