<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
