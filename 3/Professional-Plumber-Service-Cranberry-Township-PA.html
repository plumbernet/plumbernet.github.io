<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe.
