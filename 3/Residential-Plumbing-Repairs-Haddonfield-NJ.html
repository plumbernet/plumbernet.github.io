<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains.

You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
