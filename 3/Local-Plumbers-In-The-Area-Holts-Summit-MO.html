<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair bill may be in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the new heater.</p>
