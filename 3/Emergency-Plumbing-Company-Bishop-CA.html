There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure fluctuations and disc compression that might lead to false data on the workings of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can result in extreme pressure spikes that might harm parts. The results of elevated temperature can also cause extreme pressure conditions which might harm the parts in the elements. These and other negative impacts from the hydraulic conditions must be recognized and their cause remedied. If parts are changed and the hydraulic conditions are not corrected, the new parts can soon be made inoperative.</p>
