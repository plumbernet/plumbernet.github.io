<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
