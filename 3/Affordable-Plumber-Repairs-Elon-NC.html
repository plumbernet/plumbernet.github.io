Backflow prevention devices run by allowing water to stream in only one direction. In an unprotected water service connection, safe and clean water can flow both in and out of a structure or fixture. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a building for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw infected water in reverse into the water system. For instance, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from car cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might go into the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray advancement might stream backwards into the drinkable water system.
