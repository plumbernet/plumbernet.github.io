We will repair it again-no charge if a repair or equipment that we have supplied and set up stops working in the first year.</p>
<p>If you want it to work well for years to come, your garbage disposal installation needs to be brought out by a professional plumber. It is a relatively simple device that draws food scraps down into a barbed grinder ring that turns at high speeds, which crushes the scraps. When they are small enough, they travel through to the rest of the wastewater to be gotten rid of. If you have a battle drain setup, it normally takes up your kitchen sink drain but can be set up on simply one side.</p>
<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>The EcoWater Compact Series Water Softening System is a compact single tank cabinet" style softener, making it a hassle-free and reliable system for your home. Friendly, knowledgeable specialist. He got our drain cleared out in a really effective and professional  manner. I would not think twice to call Roto-Rooter for any future needs. Toilet Runs Intermittently - Do not you hate it when the toilet runs 5 minutes after you flushed?
