<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each component. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the element, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
