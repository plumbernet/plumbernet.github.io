<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No warm water in your home? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your hot water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these concerns, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs or perhaps a replacement. While a few of these issues can be attributed to regular wear and tear or incorrect installation, in some cases your garbage disposal ends up being damaged by items that shouldn't be gone through it.</p>
<p>Mounted under the sink, the garbage disposal is meant for chopping up smidgens of waste food. When switched on the motor impellers and spins-- also called lugs-- throw bits of food versus a grinder ring. You should constantly run water while utilizing the garbage disposal; once the garbage disposal does its task, the water flushes the finely chopped particles down the drain.</p>
