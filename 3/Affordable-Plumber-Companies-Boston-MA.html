<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a couple of things worth understanding about garbage disposal installation. Usually, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or between $130 and $310 to have actually professional repairs done by a plumber. The per hour charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not consist of parts or products. Costs depend upon the specific repair needed, where you live, hiring a plumber vs. hiring a handyman, and whether you can DIY it.</p>
