<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Willard MO</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is merely capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
