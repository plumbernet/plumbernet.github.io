<p>In the 1990 â€² s, drought conditions determined water suppliers to execute water conservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in homes were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Constant obstructions: If the plunger has ended up being a routine fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous clogs indicate your toilet no longer has the power required to efficiently get rid of waste with each flush.</p>
