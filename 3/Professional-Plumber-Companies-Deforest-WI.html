<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that impact. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
