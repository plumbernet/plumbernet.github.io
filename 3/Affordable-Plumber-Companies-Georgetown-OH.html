If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To discover an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, however chances are you'll locate one of the exact same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
