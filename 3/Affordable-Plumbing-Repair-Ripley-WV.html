<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are long lasting in the short-term, they weaken over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are vulnerable to several kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll begin to damage from rust and may place toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We recommend replacing the steel, clay, and iron pipes in your house. This may not require entirely repiping the house, considering that more recent materials might have currently been used in some sections, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you identify precisely what work needs to be done.</p>

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
