The device enables water to push the check valves open when water is entering the building, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the wrong method. There are two different kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are frequently defined-- a minimized pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device.

A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely cracked and just requires to be changed.</p>
