<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Crestline CA</h3>
<p>It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an effectively working RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in areas based on water damage. Sufficient drainage should also be offered.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden tubes: The highly harmful insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply. An extermination company employee had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external home hose bibb (outdoors spigot). When the water supply system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through your home into the water supply.</p>
