<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement in Scarborough ME 04074</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>In addition to clearing your drains, we likewise use complete drain repair services. Everyone understands the inconvenience and mess that accompanies a sluggish drain. Even so, many people wait till the drain stops totally before they take corrective action. Call us before your problems get this bad. We assure it'll save you time and money in the long run.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>A properly designed irrigation system is essential for the health of plants in a landscape but it's likewise important for human health. An effective watering system keeps the water for landscapes different from safe and clean drinking water, preventing contamination that can trigger health problems. That's why a backflow preventer is a need on any watering task.</p>
