For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (normally sodium or often potassium).</p>
