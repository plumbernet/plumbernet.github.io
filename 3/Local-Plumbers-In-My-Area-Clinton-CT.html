<p>Last but not least, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During basic water flows at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best used in crucial areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
<p>Gas leaks are commonly found at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that permits connections and disconnections of gas appliances.
