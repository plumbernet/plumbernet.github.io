<h3>How to Save Water With Leak Detection Awareness in Centralia WA 98531</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
