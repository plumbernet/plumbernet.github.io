<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complex scientific procedure, but simple to treat. It uses salt to get rid of minerals and smells discovered in tough water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attract and connect sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push tough water through the resin beads exchanging firmness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
