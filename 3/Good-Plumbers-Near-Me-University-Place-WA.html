<p>In the 1990 ′ s, drought conditions determined water providers to carry out water preservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in houses were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models.

Continuous blockages indicate your toilet no longer has actually the power required to efficiently get rid of waste with each flush.</p>
