<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service might look like a waste of cash. Why invest in professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will suffice? While chemical drain cleaners might be an inexpensive solution, the severe ingredients corrode your inner drain pipe, over time, creating vulnerable points in the pipe that are likely to burst. Handling fixing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>

Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>
