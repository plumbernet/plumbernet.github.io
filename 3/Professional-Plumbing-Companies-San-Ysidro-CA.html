<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is consisted of six State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, one of which is also functions as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Plan Examiner for the group. Howard, the Task Supervisor, has always been valuable and helpful regarding all our concerns. He did the proposition and arranged the work for the clear out and partial sewer line repair without delay. It is constantly a satisfaction to work with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outside kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He was able to get a snake around the "Y", which lots of plumbers say they can't do, and clear the line. He is constantly pleasant, professional and goes the extra mile.</p>
