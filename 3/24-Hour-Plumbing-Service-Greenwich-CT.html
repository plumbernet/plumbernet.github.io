Current advances in toilet technology have actually made modern restrooms even more comfortable and functional. If your toilet was made prior to 1994, then it's likely costing you money every day. New toilets use practically two gallons less per flush while providing the exact same or better flushing power as their outdated counterparts.

He will also reveal you the easy method to bring a hot water heater out of your home, even if you are working alone.</p>
<p>Every toilet clogs from time to time. How often a toilet blockages depends on the strength of its flush, the tidiness of its drain pipes, and what it's trying to flush. If your toilet blocks more than once a month-or even as soon as a week!- it's most likely because mineral deposits have built up around the top of the drain or in the drain pipes themselves.</p>
