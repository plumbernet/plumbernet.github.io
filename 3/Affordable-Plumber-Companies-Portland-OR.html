<p>For shallow pipes with no nearby utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more.
