According to Sankarasubramanian et al., The typical per capita water utilize per day is higher in rural counties than metropolitan counties in all the climate regions, except in the Central and Southeast areas"1 with backwoods having less effective water supply systems2 mostly due to the relative absence of financial resources to upgrade and maintain their systems.

<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
