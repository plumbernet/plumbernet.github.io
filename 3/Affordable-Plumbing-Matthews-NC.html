<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
