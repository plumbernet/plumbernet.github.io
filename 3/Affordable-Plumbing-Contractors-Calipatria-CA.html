<p>These valves have a great deal of versatility. They're the least costly of the backflow prevention options, but they likewise provide the least quantity of protection. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, likewise called an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. When pressurized and drops to allow air to enter the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc seals and increases off the air inlet.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are installed in big, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
