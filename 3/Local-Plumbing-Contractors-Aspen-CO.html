<p>Changing your flapper might need slightly various steps than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, but possibilities are you'll find among the very same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
