No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does occur regularly than you think! Often it takes place at night when you do not notice the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical reason for backflow.
