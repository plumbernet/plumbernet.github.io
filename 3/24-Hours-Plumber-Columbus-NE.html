During hours of low need, the water flow can be utilized to fill up storage tanks, towers and tanks, which then supply water for emergency usage and durations when demand goes beyond the baseline pumping rate. A water supply source can take numerous forms, including groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, manufactured or natural ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
