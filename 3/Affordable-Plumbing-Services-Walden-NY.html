Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
