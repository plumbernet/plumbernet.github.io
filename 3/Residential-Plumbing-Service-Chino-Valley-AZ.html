<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. Due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it should be much less water.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does take place regularly than you believe! When you don't see the water was off for a couple of minutes, often it takes place at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
