<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your hot water heater installation appointment. Installing gas lines can bring a brand-new level of service. As difficult water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause difficult water stick to the beads, and the cured water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
