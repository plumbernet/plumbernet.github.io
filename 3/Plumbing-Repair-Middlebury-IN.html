Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
