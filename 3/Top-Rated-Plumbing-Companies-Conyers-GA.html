<p>Oregon state laws governing water supply need backflow prevention assemblies to be set up on water services where cross connections can not be gotten rid of. Backflow assemblies are required to be installed on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape lawn sprinkler. The law also requires backflow assemblies in commercial facilities such as mortuaries and medical facilities, as well as commercial facilities.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Conyers GA</h3>
