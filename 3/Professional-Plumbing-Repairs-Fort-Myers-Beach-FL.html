<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. Because they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt.

A water heater is basically a household appliance that consists of a gas or electric heating system under a tank in which water is heated up and stored.

So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers manage all types of work.
