<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health risk if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of sickness or illness.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can position problems.</p>
<p>We've already seen what these 2 terms have in common, so what's the difference in between them? When it concerns the concern of tough water, a standard water softener really gets rid of magnesium, silica and calcium ions, leaving it with small quantities of what is referred to as short-lived solidity". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
