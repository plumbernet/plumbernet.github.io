<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is called fouling.

Cleaners need to be utilized according to maker guidelines to avoid contamination.</p>
<p>This post aims to deal with the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: a correctly set up water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a few complicated truths that often lead people to this erroneous conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is generally destructive. For that reason, softened water must also be corrosive, best? This is a fallacy since naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>

<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (normally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
