To discover a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but opportunities are you'll locate among the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
