<p>When you count on Roto-Rooter for hot water heater repair, maintenance or replacement, you can expect professional service from experienced plumbing professionals. Backflow prevention devices run by allowing water to flow in only one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, safe and clean water can flow both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a structure for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water backwards into the water system. For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from automobile washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might go into the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray advancement might stream backwards into the safe and clean water system. To safeguard water quality, backflow defense is required where the end user presents a danger of contaminating the city's supply of water.</p>
