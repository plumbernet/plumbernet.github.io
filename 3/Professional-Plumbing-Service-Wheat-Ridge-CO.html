<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and combined with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>
<p>If further restorations are desired, such as installing a tankless water heater or broadening the water system to accommodate a remodel, this is when those extra alterations will be made. Lastly, the drywall and other materials will be fixed, covered, and retextured so that it appears like absolutely nothing ever occurred. Polyvinylchloride pipes or PVC pipes are typically used for the main water system to your house along with the house sinks, toilet, and bathtub drain lines or vent stacks.
