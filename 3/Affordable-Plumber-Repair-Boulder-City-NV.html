Howard, the Task Manager, has constantly been informative and practical concerning all our issues. He did the proposition and set up the work for the clear out and partial sewer line repair promptly. It is constantly a satisfaction to work with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outdoors kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He was able to get a snake around the "Y", which many plumbers say they can't do, and clear the line. He is always enjoyable, professional and goes the extra mile.</p>

<h3>Drainage Installation in Boulder City Nevada</h2>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
