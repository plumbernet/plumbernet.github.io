Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

Action 2: On the new drain, apply plumber's putty around the flange, and press it into location. Then lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on the flange to keep it from moving.
