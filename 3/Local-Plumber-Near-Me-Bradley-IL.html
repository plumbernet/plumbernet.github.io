<p>This post aims to deal with the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes deterioration This is not the case: a correctly set up water softener does not make the treated water more destructive.

<h3>The Benefits of Using Professional Drainage Services in Bradley IL 60915</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is just catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
