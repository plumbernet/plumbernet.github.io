When you don't see the water was off for a few minutes, often it happens at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction projects easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow.

This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
