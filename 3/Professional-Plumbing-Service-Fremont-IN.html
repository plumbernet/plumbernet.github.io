<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your backyard. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.

However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your home and household.</p>
