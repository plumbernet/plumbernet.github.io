<p>These valves have a lot of flexibility. They're the least expensive of the backflow prevention alternatives, however they likewise supply the least quantity of defense. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, also called an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. This disc seals and rises off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to enable air to get in the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are set up in big, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
