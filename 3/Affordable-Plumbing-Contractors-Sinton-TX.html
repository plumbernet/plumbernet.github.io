<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.

There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure fluctuations and disc compression that might result in false information on the operations of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can cause extreme pressure spikes that could harm components. The effects of elevated temperature level can likewise cause extreme pressure conditions which could harm the parts in the components. These and other unfavorable results from the hydraulic conditions should be recognized and their cause fixed. If parts are changed and the hydraulic conditions are not fixed, the new parts can soon be made inoperative.</p>
