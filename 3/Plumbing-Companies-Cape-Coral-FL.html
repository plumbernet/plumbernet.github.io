<p>Our Water Softeners Are Remarkably Designed To Work.

<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler normally are installed in locations where water might cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
