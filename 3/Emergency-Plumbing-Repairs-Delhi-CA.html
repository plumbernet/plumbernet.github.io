<p>Sewer lines have one crucial role: bring wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely costly alternative.</p>
<p>Another duty of the Plumbing Division is to carry out cross connection inspections to recognize drinkable water systems that require being safeguarded from contaminates.
