<h3>Water Heater Repair in Conley Georgia</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have accomplished a development in water softening treatment utilizing a proprietary Surface Accelerated Formation (SACr) technology.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
