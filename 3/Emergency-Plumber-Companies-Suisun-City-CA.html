<p>When you've discovered the journey lever you want, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper way.
