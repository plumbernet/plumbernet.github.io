<p>Re-piping is a process of changing the supply pipes in a dwelling or business.

Corrosion of pipes might cause low water pressure, rusty colored water, lowered water flow, or leakages. If you are going to renovate it is a good time to repipe prior to you paint or finish your walls.  It is important to understand the scope of the job prior to work is begun. If you discover an isolated leak or a small part of your existing piping leaking, or valves that are corroded or cracked, it is quite perhaps a sign of a bigger issue.</p>
