<p>No other room in a house includes as many pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. We now have cleaned up and inspected the components parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their elements, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now all set to start the re-assembly procedure. Some models need the components to be removed in a specific order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a particular order. Numerous parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each part is returned into the body, it is very important to put them back in the appropriate area. It is also important that as they are put back into the body, that no contaminant is attached on the components or unintentionally positioned in the body. The components must be positioned so that the guides have the ability to preserve their created tolerances.</p>
