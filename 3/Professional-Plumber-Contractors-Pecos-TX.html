<p>Hard water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of your house, repiping may take anywhere from a number of days to a week. Typically, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs complete water shut off while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience very little disruption to your day-to-day regimen. To start the repiping procedure, the plumbing team will first cover any carpet and furniture to safeguard them from dust and debris. They will then make little cuts in the wall and drywall to locate the pipes and then get rid of and replace them, leaving as much of the initial structure material as possible intact.</p>
