<p>The quality of your house's H2O matters. You do not want to fret about the issues of tough water, and with NuvoH2O, you no longer need to! Our tankless, natural citric acid water softener is the best-rated, salt-free water softener on the market-- that's why companies like Walgreens, HGTV, Popular Science, Panda Express, and more trust us to soften their water.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can position problems.</p>
