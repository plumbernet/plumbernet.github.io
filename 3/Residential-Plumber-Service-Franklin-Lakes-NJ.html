<h3>Water Heaters & Water Filtering in Franklin Lakes New Jersey</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have accomplished an advancement in water softening treatment using an exclusive Surface Accelerated Crystallization (SACr) innovation. SACr physically removes temporary firmness without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are major limitations of present softening innovations.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>
