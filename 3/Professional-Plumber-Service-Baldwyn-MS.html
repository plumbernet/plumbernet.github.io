<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This triggers the disc to open, allowing air to bring back and go into the valve pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
