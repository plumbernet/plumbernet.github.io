<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Fairhope AL 36532</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and online in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
