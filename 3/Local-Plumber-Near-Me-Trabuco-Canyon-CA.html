By doing this you will not have a surprise expenditure on your hands when the day comes that it stops working.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing specialists can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by hooking up a hose to drain the tank to an ideal drain. Flushing the water heating tank ought to be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might supply a quick fix in the short-term, it can trigger even more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.
