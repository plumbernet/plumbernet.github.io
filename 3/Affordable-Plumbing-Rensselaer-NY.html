<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the service with hardness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is free of hardness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
