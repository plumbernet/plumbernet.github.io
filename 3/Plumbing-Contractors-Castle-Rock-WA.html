<p>Lastly, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if pricey) device is best utilized in critical areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
